Change the state of the external fault LED associated with
.Ar disk .
.Ar disk
can be the device name of the disk, like
.Cm da12 ,
or
.Ql all .
to indicate all disks attached to SES controllers.
.It Cm fault Fl u Ar /dev/sesN Ar sesid Op on | off
Change the state of the external fault LED associated with an element
connected to the SES controller.
.Ar sesid
must be the element ID of a valid item attached to the controller.
