.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libutil.h
.Ft const char*
.Fn getlocalbase "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getlocalbase
function returns the path to the local software base directory.
Normally this is the
.Pa /usr/local
directory.
First the
.Ev LOCALBASE
environment variable is checked.
If that does not exist then the
.Va user.localbase
sysctl is checked.
If that also does not exist then the value of the
.Dv _PATH_LOCALBASE
compile-time variable is used.
If that is undefined then the default of
.Pa /usr/local
is used.
.Pp
The value returned by the
.Fn getlocalbase
function shall not be modified.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Calls to
.Fn getlocalbase
will perform a setugid check on the running binary before checking the
environment.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn getlocalbase
function always succeeds and returns a pointer to a string, whose length
may exceed MAXPATHLEN if it has been derived from the environment variable
LOCALBASE.
No length checks are performed on the result.

The
.Fn getlocalbase
library function retrieves the
.Ev LOCALBASE
environment variable.
