 * Per-sandbox meta-data structure mapped read-only within the sandbox at a
 * fixed address to allow sandboxed code to find its stack, heap, etc.
 *
 * The base address must match libcheri's libcheri_sandbox.c as well as the
 * linker scripts used to statically link sandboxed code.  The offsets must
 * match struct sandbox_metadata in libcheri_sandbox_metadata.h.  See the
 * comment there for good reasons not to change these definitions if you can
 * avoid it.
 *
 * XXXRW: For reasons I don't understand, and should learn about, I can't get
 * this to usefully include in .S files.  But that is the actual goal -- they
 * should use these definitions rather than hard-coded values.
