.Ft int
.Fn cocall "void * __capability code" "void * __capability data" "void * __capability target" "void *data" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cocall
function performs a colocated call to the callee indicated by the
.Ar target
argument.
Before passing the execution to the callee, at most
.Fa len
bytes pointed to by
.Fa data
will be copied to the buffer provided by the callee; before returning the data
will be copied from the callee back to the calling side.
.Pp
The
.Ar code
and
.Ar data
arguments must point to a sealed capability pair obtained from
.Xr cosetup 2 .
The
.Ar target
argument is a capability usually retrieved with
.Xr colookup 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std cocall
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn cocall
system call
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
