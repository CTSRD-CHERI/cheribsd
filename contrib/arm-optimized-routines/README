Regular quarterly releases are tagged as vYY.MM, the latest
release is v21.02.

Source code layout:

build/          - build directory (created by make).
math/           - math subproject sources.
math/include/   - math library public headers.
math/test/      - math test and benchmark related sources.
math/tools/     - tools used for designing the algorithms.
networking/     - networking subproject sources.
networking/include/ - networking library public headers.
networking/test/ - networking test and benchmark related sources.
string/         - string routines subproject sources.
string/include/ - string library public headers.
string/test/    - string test and benchmark related sources.

The steps to build the target libraries and run the tests:

cp config.mk.dist config.mk
# edit config.mk if necessary ...
make
make check

Or building outside of the source directory:

ln -s path/to/src/Makefile Makefile
cp path/to/src/config.mk.dist config.mk
echo 'srcdir = path/to/src' >> config.mk
# further edits to config.mk
make
make check

Or building and testing the math subproject only:

make all-math
make check-math

The test system requires libmpfr and libmpc.
For example on debian linux they can be installed as:

sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev

For cross build, CROSS_COMPILE should be set in config.mk and EMULATOR
should be set for cross testing (e.g. using qemu-user or remote access
to a target machine), see the examples in config.mk.dist.
