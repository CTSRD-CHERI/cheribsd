/*
 * seq allows readers and writers to work with a consistent snapshot. Modifying
 * operations must be enclosed within a transaction delineated by
 * seq_write_beg/seq_write_end. The trick works by having the writer increment
 * the sequence number twice, at the beginning and end of the transaction.
 * The reader detects that the sequence number has not changed between its start
 * and end, and that the sequence number is even, to validate consistency.
 *
 * Some fencing (both hard fencing and compiler barriers) may be needed,
 * depending on the cpu. Modern AMD cpus provide strong enough guarantees to not
 * require any fencing by the reader or writer.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * writers:
 *     lock_exclusive(&obj->lock);
 *     seq_write_begin(&obj->seq);
 *     obj->var1 = ...;
 *     obj->var2 = ...;
 *     seq_write_end(&obj->seq);
 *     unlock_exclusive(&obj->lock);
 *
 * readers:
 *    int var1, var2;
 *    seq_t seq;
 *
 *    for (;;) {
 *    	      seq = seq_read(&obj->seq);
 *            var1 = obj->var1;
 *            var2 = obj->var2;
 *            if (seq_consistent(&obj->seq, seq))
 *                   break;
 *    }
 *    .....
 *
 * Writers may not block or sleep in any way.
 *
 * There are 2 minor caveats in this implementation:
 *
 * 1. There is no guarantee of progress. That is, a large number of writers can
 * interfere with the execution of the readers and cause the code to live-lock
 * in a loop trying to acquire a consistent snapshot.
 *
 * 2. If the reader loops long enough, the counter may overflow and eventually
 * wrap back to its initial value, fooling the reader into accepting the
 * snapshot.  Given that this needs 4 billion transactional writes across a
 * single contended reader, it is unlikely to ever happen.
