.Nd Advansys ISA/VL/PCI Narrow 8bit SCSI Host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device adv"
.Pp
For one or more VL/ISA cards:
.Cd "device isa"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the narrow 8bit
.Tn SCSI
bus connected to the Advanced Systems Products, Inc.
.Tn ASC900 ,
.Tn ASC1000 ,
.Tn ASC1090 ,
.Tn ASC1200 ,
.Tn ASC3030 ,
.Tn ASC3050 ,
and
.Tn ASC3150
host adapter chips.
The following tables list the AdvanSys products using these chips,
their bus attachment type, maximum sync rate, and the maximum number of
commands that can be handled by the adapter concurrently.

.It
This board has been shipped by HP with the 4020i CD-R drive.
The board has no BIOS so it cannot control a boot device, but
it can control any secondary SCSI device.
.It
This board has been sold by Iomega as a Jaz Jet PCI adapter.
.It
This board has been sold by SIIG as the i540 SpeedMaster.
.It
This board has been sold by SIIG as the i542 SpeedMaster.

.Pp
For ISA or Vesa Local Bus adapters, one kernel hints entry is required
for every card to be attached by the system.
Specific values for the port address, irq and drq may be specified.
If unspecified, the driver will query the device for its current
settings and use those.
If the port address is unspecified, the driver will search for it at
one of the possible addresses.
Cards configured for ISA PNP addresses are found automatically.
The possible port addresses for these card are 0x110, 0x130,
0x150, 0x190, 0x210, 0x230, 0x250, and 0x330.
.Pp
Per target configuration performed in the
.Tn AdvanceWare
menu, which is accessible at boot,
is honored by this driver.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers,
maximum synchronous negotiation rate, disconnection, tagged queueing,
and the host adapter's SCSI ID.
The global setting for the maximum number of tagged transactions allowed
per target is not honored as the CAM SCSI system will automatically determine
the maximum number of tags a device can receive as well as guarantee fair
resource allocation among devices.
