.Sh NAME
.Nm xe
.Nd "Xircom PCMCIA Ethernet device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device xe"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_xe_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
The
.Nm
driver is not present in
.Fx 13.0
and later.
See https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for more
information.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports
.Tn PCMCIA
Ethernet adapters based on Xircom CE2- and CE3-class hardware.
This includes devices made by Xircom along with
various
.Tn OEM
manufacturers.
.Pp
Please note that the
.Nm
driver only supports
.Tn PCMCIA
cards and their Ethernet functions.
.Nm
does not support the on-board modem device located on some
version of the Ethernet/modem combo cards.
In particular, Xircom RealPort2 cards are not supported by this driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm autoselect"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of media type and options.
.It Cm 10Base2/BNC
Select 10Mbps operation on a BNC coaxial connector.
.It Cm 10BaseT/UTP
Select 10Mbps operation on a RJ-45 connector.
.It Cm 100BaseTX
Select 100Mbps operation.
.El
.Pp
Note that 100BaseTX operation is not available on CE2-class cards,
while the 10Base2/BNC mode is only available on CE2-class cards.
Full-duplex
operation is currently not supported.
For more information on configuring network interface devices,
see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "xe%d: Cannot allocate ioport"
.It "xe%d: Cannot allocate irq"
A fatal initialization error occurred while attempting to allocate
system resources for the card.
.It "xe%d: Unable to fix your %s combo card"
A fatal initialization error occurred while attempting to attach an
Ethernet/modem combo card.
.It "xe%d: watchdog timeout: resetting card"
The card failed to generate an interrupt acknowledging a
transmitted packet.
May indicate a
.Tn PCMCIA
configuration problem.
.It "xe%d: no carrier"
The card has lost all contact with the network; this
usually indicates a cable problem.
