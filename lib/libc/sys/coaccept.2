.Sh NAME
.Nm COCALL
.Nd accept a colocated call
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn coaccept "void * __capability code" "void * __capability data" "void *data" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn coaccept
function accepts a colocated call.
Before passing the execution to the callee, at most
.Fa len
bytes pointed to by
.Fa data
will be copied from buffer provided by the caller; before returning the data
will be copied back to the caller.
.Pp
The
.Ar code
and
.Ar data
arguments must point to a sealed capability pair obtained from
.Xr cosetup 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std coaccept
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn coaccept
system call
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa code or
.Fa data
arguments are invalid.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa data
argument
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Basic usage example:
.Bd -literal
	char buf[MAXBSIZE];
	void * __capability switcher_code;
	void * __capability switcher_data;

	error = cosetup(COSETUP_COACCEPT, &switcher_code, &switcher_data);
	if (error != 0)
		err(1, "cosetup");

	error = coregister("target-name", NULL);
	if (error != 0)
		err(1, "coregister");

	for (;;) {
		error = coaccept(switcher_code, switcher_data, buf, sizeof(buf));
		if (error != 0)
			err(1, "coaccept");
	}
