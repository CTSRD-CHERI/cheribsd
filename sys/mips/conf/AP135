# AP135 - the QCA955x SoC reference design
#
# This contains a QCA9558 MIPS74k SoC with on-board 3x3 2GHz wifi,
# 128MiB RAM, an AR8327 5-port gigabit ethernet switch and
# a QCA 11ac 5GHz AP NIC.
#
# The to things not currently support are the QCA 11ac NIC and
# PCIe host controllers - there's two of them, and the existing
# PCIe code here doesn't support that just yet.
