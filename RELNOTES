2fb4f839f3fc,d89513ed2050,3413ee88c39d,f97a19ecb985,021562c5020d,431d2a81d421:
	sendmail has been updated to the latest upstream version (8.17.1).

4a30d7bb373c,d670a8f7c596,af01b4722577,4e240e55d818:
	The growfs(7) script can now add a swap partition at the end of
	the expansion area, and does so by default if there is no existing
	swap.  See growfs(7).

86edb11e7491:
	llvm-objump is now always installed as objdump.

616f32ea6da7:
	mta_start_script along with othermta rc.d script has been retired.

a67b925ff3e5:
	The default mail transport agent is now dma(8) replacing sendmail.

22893e584032:
	L3 filtering on if_bridge will do surprising things which aren't
	fail-safe, so net.link.bridge.pfil_member and
	net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge now default to zero.

f0bc4ed144fc:
	A new DTrace provider, kinst, is introduced and documented in
	dtrace_kinst(4).  The provider allows kernel instructions to be traced,
	similar to the FBT (function boundary tracing) provider except that all
	instructions may be probed instead of logical entry and return
	instructions.  The provider is currently amd64-only.

0eea46fb1f83:
	Removed telnetd.

981ef32230b2,33721eb991d8:
	These commits make the use of NFSv4.1/4.2 mounts with the "intr"
	mount option fairly usable, although not 100% correct, so long as
	the "nolockd" mount option is used as well.  See the mount_nfs(8)
	manual page for more information.

b875d4f5ddcb,0685c73cfe88:
	The NFSv4.1/4.2 client and server will now generate console messages
	if sessions are broken, suggesting that users check to ensure
	that the /etc/hostid strings are unique for all NFSv4.1/4.2 clients.

240afd8c1fcc:
	makefs(8) has ZFS support; it can create a ZFS pool, backed by a
	single disk vdev, containing one or more datasets populated from
	the staging directory.

78ee8d1c4cda,f4f56ff43dbd:
	The in-tree qat(4) driver has been replaced with Intel's QAT driver.
	The new version provides additional interfaces to the chipset's
	cryptographic and compression offload functionality.

	This will have no visible change for most users; however, the new
	driver does not support Atom C2000 chipsets.  To preserve support for
	those chipsets, the old driver has been renamed to qat_c2xxx and kept
	in the tree.  Users of qat(4) on C2000 hardware will thus need to
	ensure that qat_c2xxx(4) is loaded instead of qat(4).

da5b7e90e740,5a8fceb3bd9f,7b0a665d72c0,13ec1e3155c7,318d0db5fe8a,1ae2c59bcf21:
	Boottrace is a new kernel-userspace interface for capturing trace
	events during system boot and shutdown. Event annotations are
	present in:

	- The boot and shutdown paths in the kernel
	- Some key system utilities (init(8), shutdown(8), reboot(8))
	- rc(8) scripts (via boottrace(8))

	In contrast to other existing boot-time tracing facilities like TSLOG,
	Boottrace focuses on the ease of use and is aimed primarily at system
	administrators.

	It is available in the default GENERIC kernel and can be enabled by
	toggling a single sysctl(8) variable.

	See boottrace(4) for more details.

05a1d0f5d7ac:
	Kernel TLS offload now supports receive-side offload of TLS 1.3.

19dc64451179:
	if_stf now supports 6rd (RFC5969).

c1d255d3ffdb, 3968b47cd974, bd452dcbede6:
	Add WiFi 6 support to wpa.

ba48d52ca6c8,4ac3d08a9693,2533eca1c2b9:
	The default bell tone is now 800Hz. It may be set with kbdcontrol
	again. There's devd integration for people wishing to use their sound
	cards for the beep.

92b3e07229ba:
	net.inet.tcp.nolocaltimewait enabled by default.  It prevents
	creation of timewait entries for TCP connections that were
	terminated locally.

d410b585b6f0:
	sh(1) is now the default shell for the root user.

396851c20aeb:
	libncursesw has been split into libtinfow and libncursesw, linker
	scripts should make it transparent for consumers. pkg-config files
	are also now installed to ease ports detecting the ncurses setup from
	base.

a422084abbda:
	LLVM's MemorySanitizer can now be used in amd64 kernels.  See the
	kmsan(9) manual page for more information.

38da497a4dfc:
	LLVM's AddressSanitizer can now be used in amd64 kernels.  See the
	kasan(9) manual page for more information.

f39dd6a97844,23f24377b1a9,628bd30ab5a4:
	One True Awk has been updated to the latest from upstream
	(20210727). All the FreeBSD patches, but one, have now been
	either up streamed or discarded.  Notable changes include:
		o Locale is no longer used for ranges
		o Various bugs fixed
		o Better compatibility with gawk and mawk

	The one FreeBSD change, likely to be removed in FreeBSD 14, is that
	we still allow hex numbers, prefixed with 0x, to be parsed and
	interpreted as hex numbers while all other awks (including one
	true awk now) interpret them as 0 in line with awk's historic
	behavior.

	A second change, less likely to be noticed, is the historic wart
	if -Ft meaning to use hard tab characters as the field separator
	is deprecated and will likely be removed in FreeBSD 14.

ee29e6f31111:
	Commit ee29e6f31111 added a new sysctl called vfs.nfsd.srvmaxio
	that can be used to increase the maximum I/O size for the NFS
	server to any power of 2 up to 1Mbyte while the nfsd(8) is not running.
	The FreeBSD NFS client can now be set to use a 1Mbyte I/O size
	via the vfs.maxbcachebuf tunable and the Linux NFS client
	can also do 1Mbyte I/O.
	kern.ipc.maxsockbuf will need to be increased.  A console
	message will suggest a setting for it.

d575e81fbcfa:
	gconcat(8) has added support for appending devices to the device
	not present at creation time.

76681661be28:
	Remove support for asymmetric cryptographic operations from
	the kernel open cryptographic framework (OCF).

a145cf3f73c7:
	The NFSv4 client now uses the highest minor version of NFSv4
	supported by the NFSv4 server by default instead of minor version 0,
	for NFSv4 mounts.
	The "minorversion" mount option may be used to override this default.
