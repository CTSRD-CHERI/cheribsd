.Sh NAME
.Nm mly
.Nd Mylex AcceleRAID/eXtremeRAID family driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device da"
.Cd "device mly"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mly_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
The
.Nm
driver is not present in
.Fx 13.0 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Mylex AcceleRAID and eXtremeRAID-family
PCI to SCSI RAID controllers with version 6.00 and later
firmware.
.Pp
Logical devices (array drives) attached to the controller are presented
to the SCSI subsystem as though they were direct-access devices on a
virtual SCSI bus.
Physical devices which are not claimed by a logical
device are presented on SCSI channels which match the physical channels
on the controller.
.Sh HARDWARE
Controllers supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Mylex AcceleRAID 160
.It
Mylex AcceleRAID 170
.It
Mylex AcceleRAID 352
.It
Mylex eXtremeRAID 2000
.It
Mylex eXtremeRAID 3000
.El
.Pp
Compatible Mylex controllers not listed should work, but have not been
verified.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Ss Controller initialisation phase
.Bl -diag
.It "mly%d: controller initialisation started"
.It "mly%d: initialisation complete"
.Pp
The controller firmware has started initialisation.
Normally this process is performed by the controller BIOS,
but the driver may need
to do this in cases where the BIOS has failed, or is not compatible
(e.g.\& on non-x86 systems).
.It "mly%d: drive spinup in progress"
.Pp
Drive startup is in progress; this may take several minutes.
.It "mly%d: mirror race recovery failed, one or more drives offline"
.It "mly%d: mirror race recovery in progress"
.It "mly%d: mirror race recovery on a critical drive"
.Pp
These error codes are undocumented.
.It "mly%d: FATAL MEMORY PARITY ERROR"
.Pp
Firmware detected a fatal memory error; the driver will not attempt to
attach to this controller.
.It "mly%d: unknown initialisation code %x"
.Pp
An unknown error occurred during initialisation; it will be ignored.
.El
.Ss Driver initialisation/shutdown phase
.Bl -diag
.It "mly%d: can't enable busmaster feature"
.It "mly%d: memory window not available"
.It "mly%d: can't allocate register window"
.It "mly%d: can't allocate interrupt"
.It "mly%d: can't set up interrupt"
.Pp
The system's PCI BIOS has not correctly configured the controller's
PCI interface; initialisation has failed and the driver will not
attach to this controller.
.It "mly%d: can't allocate parent DMA tag"
.It "mly%d: can't allocate buffer DMA tag"
.It "mly%d: can't allocate command packet DMA tag"
.It "mly%d: can't allocate scatter/gather DMA tag"
.It "mly%d: can't allocate s/g table"
.It "mly%d: can't allocate memory mailbox DMA tag"
.It "mly%d: can't allocate memory mailbox"
.Pp
A resource allocation error occurred while initialising the driver;
initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to this
controller.
.It "mly%d: BTL rescan result corrupted"
.Pp
The results of a scan for an attached device were corrupted.
One or more devices may not be correctly reported.
.It "mly%d: flushing cache..."
.Pp
The controller cache is being flushed prior to detach or shutdown.
