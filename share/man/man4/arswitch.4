.Sh NAME
.Nm arswitch
.Nd driver for Atheros Fast Ethernet switch
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device mdio"
.Cd "device etherswitch"
.Cd "device arswitch"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides a management interface to multiple Atheros
fast ethernet switch chips:
.Bl -tag -compact -width "AR7240"
.It AR7240
Wireless Network Processor SOC with five Fast Ethernet PHYs
.It AR8216
Fast Ethernet Switch
.It AR8226
.It AR8316
Six-port Gigabit Ethernet Switch
.It AR8327
Seven-port Gigabit Ethernet Switch
.It AR9340
Wireless networking SoC
.El
.Pp
The driver uses an
.Xr mdio 4
or
.Xr miibus 4
interface to configure the ethernet interface.
.Pp
This driver supports port based vlan, and
IEEE 802.1Q (QinQ).
These options can be configured with the
.Xr etherswitchcfg 8
command.
.Nm
supports
.Dv addtag ,
.Dv striptag ,
and
.Dv doubletag .
.Dv addtag
and
.Dv striptag
are mutually exclusive.
.Pp
Setting the switch MAC address is not supported.

.Xr etherswitchcfg 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 12.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
manual was written by
