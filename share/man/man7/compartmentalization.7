.Dt COMPARTMENTALIZATION 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm compartmentalization ,
.Nm c18n
.Nd library-based software compartmentalization
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This document contains instructions for using the library-based
compartmentalization (c18n) prototype.
.Pp
To launch a dynamically-linked pure-capability application with library-based
compartmentalization, use the special runtime linker located at
.Pa /libexec/ld-elf-c18n.so.1 .
This can be done either explicitly, by invoking
.Pp
.Dl /libexec/ld-elf-c18n.so.1 Ar executable
.Pp
or implicitly, by setting the
.Sy INTERP
field of the program header of the target executable to the special linker's
path.
Said
.Sy INTERP
field can be inspected by invoking
.Pp
.Dl readelf -l Ar executable
.Pp
and can be set during the linking phase of compilation, typically by supplying
the following option
.Pp
.Dl -Wl,--dynamic-linker=/libexec/ld-elf-c18n.so.1
.Pp
to the compiler.
Alternatively, use the
.Sy patchelf
utility to directly modify the
.Sy INTERP
field of an executable, although it is reportedly unreliable at times.
.Pp
Environment variables recognized by
.Xr rtld 1
should adopt the prefix LD_C18N_ when compartmentalization is enabled.
For example, LD_LIBRARY_PATH becomes LD_C18N_LIBRARY_PATH.
.Pp
Compartmentalization currently depends on modified versions of
.Lb libc
and
.Lb libthr .
These are located in
.Pa /usr/lib/c18n .
The modified runtime linker automatically searches from these paths first so
that modified libraries are used.
.Sh COMPARTMENT TRANSITION TRACING
Compartment transitions can be traced with the
.Xr ktrace 1
facility.
To generate a trace, set the environment variable LD_C18N_UTRACE_COMPARTMENT
and invoke the executable with
.Xr ktrace 1 .
.Sh COMPARTMENT TRANSITION OVERHEAD SIMULATION
To simulate the overhead of making a system call during each compartment
transition, set the environment variable LD_C18N_COMPARTMENT_OVERHEAD and invoke
the executable.
Each compartment transition will then make a
.Xr getpid 2
system call.
.Sh LIMITATIONS
This work is of a highly experimental nature.
The author has tested it on applications such as
.Xr tmux 1 ,
but crashes are likely when running complex pieces of software.
.Pp
The current prototype only contains a set of
.Em mechanisms
for implementing library-based compartmentalization.
No
.Em policy
has been enforced yet.
.Pp
Below is a list of known limitations and problems.

.Bl -bullet
.It
Compatibility with C++ software is not expected.
.It
Stack unwinding is not expected to work.
This includes C++ exceptions, stack tracing in debuggers, and usage of
.Lb libunwind .
.It
.Xr sigaltstack 2
does not work as expected.
This impacts some applications that use an alternative stack to handle stack-overflow
exceptions.
.It
.Xr getcontext 3 ,
.Xr setcontext 3 ,
and related functions do not work as expected.
This impacts certain threading and coroutine libraries.
