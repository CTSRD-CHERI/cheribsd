 * Special ".note" entry specifying the ABI version.  See
 * http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/elf-notes.html
 * for more information.
 *
 * For all arches except sparc, gcc emits the section directive for the
 * following struct with a PROGBITS type.  However, newer versions of binutils
 * (after 2.16.90) require the section to be of NOTE type, to guarantee that the
 * .note.ABI-tag section correctly ends up in the first page of the final
 * executable.
 *
 * Unfortunately, there is no clean way to tell gcc to use another section type,
 * so this C file (or the C file that includes it) must be compiled in multiple
 * steps:
 *
 * - Compile the .c file to a .s file.
 * - Edit the .s file to change the 'progbits' type to 'note', for the section
 *   directive that defines the .note.ABI-tag section.
 * - Compile the .s file to an object file.
 *
 * These steps are done in the invididual Makefiles for each applicable arch.
