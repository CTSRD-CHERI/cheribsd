.Dt RLOGIN 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rlogin
.Nd remote login
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ar rlogin
.Op Fl 468DEd
.Op Fl e Ar char
.Op Fl i Ar localname
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Ar host
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
.Nm
is deprecated and will be removed from future versions of the
.Fx
base system.
If
.Nm
is still required, it can be installed from ports or packages
(net/bsdrcmds).
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility starts a terminal session on a remote host
.Ar host .
.Pp
The standard Berkeley
.Pa rhosts
authorization mechanism is used.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl 8
Allow an eight-bit input data path at all times; otherwise
parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's stop and start
characters are other than
^S/^Q.
.It Fl D
Set the TCP_NODELAY socket option which can improve interactive response
at the expense of increased network load.
.It Fl E
Stop any character from being recognized as an escape character.
When used with the
.Fl 8
option, this provides a completely transparent connection.
.It Fl d
Turn on socket debugging (see
.Xr setsockopt 2 )
on the TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.
.It Fl e
Allow user specification of the escape character, which is
.Dq ~
by default.
This specification may be as a literal character, or as an octal
value in the form \ennn.
.It Fl i
Allow the caller to specify a different local name to be used
for authentication.
This option is restricted to processes with uid 0.
.It Fl l
Specify a different
.Ar username
for the remote login.
If this option is not specified, your local username will be used.
.El
.Pp
A line of the form
.Dq Ao escape char Ac Ns \&.
disconnects from the remote host.
Similarly, the line
.Dq Ao escape char Ac Ns ^Z
will suspend the
.Nm
session, and
.Dq Ao escape\ char Ac Ns Ao delayed-suspend\ char Ac
suspends the
send portion of the
.Nm
session, but allows output from the remote system.
By default, the tilde
.Pq Dq ~
character is the escape character, and
normally control-Y
.Pq Dq ^Y
is the delayed-suspend character.
.Pp
All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
the
.Nm
is transparent.
Flow control via ^S/^Q and flushing of input and output on interrupts
are handled properly.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable is utilized by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width TERM
.It Ev TERM
Determines the user's terminal type.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/hosts -compact
.It Pa /etc/hosts
.It Pa /etc/hosts.equiv
.It Ev $HOME Ns Pa /.rhosts
.El

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Pp
IPv6 support was added by WIDE/KAME project.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility will be replaced by
.Xr telnet 1
in the near future.
.Pp
More of the environment should be propagated.
