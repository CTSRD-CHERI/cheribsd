.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This command is obsolete.
Users are advised to use
.Xr autofs 5
instead.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility takes a set of system configuration information, and generates
a coordinated set of
.Xr amd 8 ,
.Xr mount 8
and
.Xr mountd 8
configuration files.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a Ar autodir
Specifies the directory name in which to place the automounter's
mount points.
This defaults to
.Pa /a .
.It Fl b Ar bootparams_prefix
Specifies the prefix for the
.Pa bootparams
file.
If it is not given, then the file will not be generated.
The file will be constructed for the destination machine and will be
placed into a file named
.Pa bootparams
and prefixed by the
.Ar bootparams_prefix
string.
The file generated contains a list of entries describing each
diskless client that can boot from the destination machine.
.It Fl d Ar dumpsets_prefix
Specifies the prefix for the
.Pa dumpsets
file.
If it is not specified, then the file will not be generated.
The file will be for the destination machine and will be placed into a file
named
.Pa dumpsets
prefixed by the
.Ar dumpsets_prefix
string.
This file is for use by
.Tn Imperial College's
local backup system.
.It Fl e Ar exports_prefix
Defines the prefix for the
.Pa exports
files.
If it is not given, then the file will not be generated.
For each machine defined in the configuration files as having disks,
and
.Pa exports
file is constructed and given a file name determined by the name of the
machine, prefixed with the
.Ar exports_prefix
string.
If a machine is defined as diskless, then no
file will be created for it.
The files contain entries
for directories on the machine that may be exported to clients.
.It Fl f Ar fstabs_prefix
This defines the prefix for the
.Pa fstab
files.
The files will only be created if this prefix is defined.
For each machine defined in the configuration files, a
.Pa fstab
file is created with the file name determined by prefixing this
.Ar fstabs_prefix
string with the name of the machine.
These files contain entries
for file systems and partitions to mount at boot time.
.It Fl h Ar hostname
Defines the hostname of the destination machine to process for.
If this is not specified, it defaults to the local machine name,
as returned by
.Xr gethostname 3 .
.It Fl m Ar automounts_prefix
Defines the prefix for the automounter files.
The maps will
only be produced if this option is specified.
The mount maps
suitable for the network defined by the configuration files will
be placed into files with names calculated by prefixing the
.Ar automounts_prefix
string to the name of each map.
.It Fl q
Selects quite mode.
Only error messages that are generated will
be displayed.
.It Fl v
Selects verbose mode.
When this is activated, more messages
will be displayed, and all information discovered when performing the semantic
analysis phase will be displayed.
Each verbose message
is output to the standard output on a line starting with a `#'
character.
.It Fl D Xo
.Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar string
.Xc
Defines a symbol
.Ar name
for the preprocessor when reading the configuration files.
Equivalent to the
.Em #define
directive.
.It Fl I Ar dir
This option is passed into the preprocessor for the configuration
files.
It specifies directories in which to find include files.
.It Fl U Ar name
Removes and initial definition of the symbol
.Ar name .
Inverse of the
.Fl D
option.
.It Ar config
One or more configuration files to be passed as input to
.Nm .
