.Sh NAME
.Nm qtrace
.Nd start and stop instruction tracing in a QEMU host VM
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
exec
.Ar command
.Op Ar ...
.Nm
start
.Nm
stop
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility starts and stops logging of instruction traces in a QEMU host
virtual machine.
The kernel may be configured to execute in one of two modes using the
.Xr sysctl 8
.Dv hw.qemu_trace_perthread :
when disabled, tracing is global (across all processes) and can be controlled
using the
.Dq start
and
.Dq stop
commands, or used with
.Dq exec ;
when enabled, tracing is per-thread, and is enabled and disabled for
hierarchies of processes using only the
.Dq exec
command.
.Pp
The
.Dq start
and
.Dq stop
commands start and stop global tracing when run.
.Pp
The
.Dq exec
command forks a child, starts logging, calls
.Xr execvp 3
to run the
.Ar command
and its arguments and stops logging when the child exits.
.Pp
When the
.Dv hw.qemu_trace_perthread
.Xr sysctl 8
is enabled, the kernel will enable and disable tracing during context
swiching, turning on tracing only for threads that have been specifically
marked to be traced.
In this mode, other processes and threads in the system will not be traced,
reducing potential noise in the resulting log.
.Pp
Due to the volume of output in an instruction trace, file I/O may be
backlogged for tens of second (or more) after tracing ends so make
sure it has stopped before examining the output.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Logging is triggered through special nop instructions and is a virtual
machine property so the results of running
.Nm
in multiple login are apt of be confusing.
