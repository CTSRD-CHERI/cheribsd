SSH-SK-HELPER(8)            System Manager's Manual           SSH-SK-HELPER(8)

NAME
     ssh-sk-helper M-bM-^@M-^S OpenSSH helper for FIDO authenticator support

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-sk-helper [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     ssh-sk-helper is used by ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), and ssh-keygen(1) to
     access keys provided by a FIDO authenticator.

     ssh-sk-helper is not intended to be invoked directly by the user.

     A single option is supported:

     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh-sk-helper to print debugging messages
             about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging problems.
             Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

             Note that ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), and ssh-keygen(1) will
             automatically pass the -v flag to ssh-sk-helper when they have
             themselves been placed in debug mode.

SEE ALSO
     ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), ssh-keygen(1)

HISTORY
     ssh-sk-helper first appeared in OpenBSD 6.7.
