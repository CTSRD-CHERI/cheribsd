.Sh NAME
.Nm wi
.Nd "Lucent Hermes, and Intersil PRISM IEEE 802.11 driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device wi"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_wi_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for 802.11b wireless network adapters based around
the Lucent Hermes, Intersil PRISM-II, Intersil PRISM-2.5, and Intersil
Prism-3 chipsets.
All chipsets provide a similar interface to the driver.
Only the Intersil chipsets support access point operation or WPA.
Very old versions of firmware are not supported at all.
Older versions of the firmware that are supported may severely limit
the ability to use these cards in newer networks.
Only relatively recent versions of Intersil firmware supports WPA.
See CAVEATS for details.
All host/device interaction is via programmed I/O, even on those cards
that support a DMA interface.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
supports
.Cm station ,
.Cm adhoc ,
.Cm adhoc-demo ,
.Cm hostap ,
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
Only one
virtual interface may be configured at a time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver come in a variety of packages, though the most common
are of the PCMCIA type.
In many cases, the PCI version of a wireless card is simply
a PCMCIA card bundled with a PCI adapter.
The PCI adapters come in two flavors: true PCMCIA bridges and
dumb PCMCIA bridges.
A true PCMCIA bridge (such as those sold by Lucent) will attach
as a real PCMCIA controller.
The wireless card will then attach to the PCMCIA bus.
Wireless cards in PCMCIA slots may be inserted and ejected on the fly.
.Pp
A dumb bridge, on the other hand, does not show up as a true PCMCIA bus.
The wireless card will simply appear to the host as a normal PCI
device and will not require any PCMCIA support.
Cards in this type of adapter should only be removed when the
machine is powered down.
.Pp
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:

.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (ie: connect to an access point):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x8736639624 weptxkey 1
.Ed
.Pp
Join a Lucent legacy demo ad-hoc network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev wi0 wlanmode ahdemo \e
    inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net
.Ed
.Pp
Join/create an IBSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev wi0 wlanmode adhoc wi0 \e
    inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net
.Ed
.Pp
Create a host-based access point (Prism only):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev wi0 wlanmode hostap \e
    inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_ap
.Ed
.Pp
Create a host-based access point with WEP enabled (Prism only)
and plumb it into bridge to fxp0:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wi0 wlanmode hostap \e
    inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_ap \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1
ifconfig bridge0 create
ifconfig bridge0 addm wlan0 addm fxp0 up
.Ed
.Pp
This will give you the same functionality as an access point.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "wi%d: init failed"
The WaveLAN card failed to become ready after an initialization command
was issued.
.It "wi%d: failed to allocate %d bytes on NIC"
The driver was unable to allocate memory for transmit frames in the
NIC's on-board RAM.
This can also be an indication of an incorrectly configured interrupt.
.It "wi%d: device timeout"
The WaveLAN card failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a transmit
command.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The original
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq Mt wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu .
This man page comes from
.Ox .
.Sh CAVEATS
The driver will reject devices with old firmware to
avoid dealing with numerous defects.
Unfortunately the driver does not support downloading new firmware
to the card so if new firmware is needed users will have to boot
a different system to accomplish this.
.Pp
Intersil Prism cards must have firmware versions 0.8.0 or later and
version 1.7.0 or later are required to support functionality such as WPA.
Some users of Prism-II and 2.5 based cards report that station firmware
version 1.3.4 works better for them in hostap than 1.4.9.
Older versions of the Prism station firmware have a number of issues
with hostap mode.
The IBSS/adhoc mode appears to work well on station firmware 1.3.1 and
later.
The IBSS/adhoc mode appears to have problems for some people with
older versions of station firmware.
.Pp
Lucent cards prior to firmware version 6.0.6 do not implement IBSS
mode and are not supported.
.Pp
Prior versions of
.Nm
supported Symbol firmware.
That support has been removed due to persistent problems with this
firmware as well as getting proper documentation on this firmware.
.Pp
Hermes 2 and Hermes 3 chips are not supported by this driver.
.Pp
Here's the above requirements in the form of a table
.Pp
.Bl -column -compact "Prims II/2.5" "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx"
.Em "Firmware	Minimum	WPA	Host AP	Adhoc/IBSS"
Prism II/2.5	0.8.0	1.7.0	1.3.4	1.3.1
Prism 3	0.8.0	1.7.0	1.4.9	1.3.1
Hermes	6.0.6	none	none	6.0.6
Symbol	none	none	none	none

.Sh BUGS
Not all the new messages are documented here, and many of them are
indications of transient errors that are not indications of serious
problems.
