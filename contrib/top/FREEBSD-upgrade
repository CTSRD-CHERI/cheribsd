This file contains notes regarding the upgrade of top(1).  See the vendor
import instructions at:

	https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/committers-guide/subversion-primer.html#svn-advanced-use-vendor-imports

The upstream project pages for top(1) are:

	http://www.unixtop.org/

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/unixtop/

contrib/top/machine.h specifies an interface that must be provided by the
target OS.  That interface is implemented in usr.bin/top/machine.c

To enable building on case-insensitive filesystems, the following files were
renamed:

	contrib/top/top.X 		-> contrib/top/top.xs
	contrib/top/top.local.H	-> contrib/top/top.local.hs
