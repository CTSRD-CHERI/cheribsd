.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto
.Nd OpenCrypto algorithms
.Sh SYNOPSIS
In the kernel configuration file:
.Cd "device crypto"
.Pp
Or load the crypto.ko module.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The following cryptographic algorithms that are part of the OpenCrypto
framework have the following requirements.
.Pp
Cipher algorithms:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv CRYPTO_AES_CBC"
.It Dv CRYPTO_AES_CBC
.Bl -tag -width "Block size :" -compact -offset indent
.It IV size :
16
.It Block size :
16
.It Key size :
16, 24 or 32
.El
.Pp
This algorithm implements Cipher-block chaining.
.It Dv CRYPTO_AES_NIST_GCM_16
.Bl -tag -width "Block size :" -compact -offset indent
.It IV size :
12
.It Block size :
1
.It Key size :
16, 24 or 32
.It Digest size :
16
.El
.Pp
This algorithm implements Galois/Counter Mode.
This cipher uses AEAD
.Pq Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
mode.
.Pp
The authentication tag will be read/written from/to the offset
.Va crp_digest_start
specified in the request.
.Pp
Note: You must provide an IV on every call.
.It Dv CRYPTO_AES_ICM
.Bl -tag -width "Block size :" -compact -offset indent
.It IV size :
16
.It Block size :
1
.It Key size :
16, 24 or 32
.El
.Pp
This algorithm implements Integer Counter Mode.
This is similar to what most people call counter mode, but instead of the
counter being split into a nonce and a counter part, then entire nonce is
used as the initial counter.
This does mean that if a counter is required that rolls over at 32 bits,
the transaction need to be split into two parts where the counter rolls over.
The counter incremented as a 128-bit big endian number.
.Pp
Note: You must provide an IV on every call.
.It Dv CRYPTO_AES_XTS
.Bl -tag -width "Block size :" -compact -offset indent
.It IV size :
8
.It Block size :
16
.It Key size :
32 or 64
.El
.Pp
This algorithm implements XEX Tweakable Block Cipher with Ciphertext Stealing
as defined in NIST SP 800-38E.
.Pp
NOTE: The ciphertext stealing part is not implemented which is why this cipher
is listed as having a block size of 16 instead of 1.
