This directory contains virgin copies of the original distribution files
on a "vendor" branch.  Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to upgrade
the files in this directory via patches and a cvs commit.

To upgrade to a newer version of traceroute, when it is available:

	1. Unpack the new version into an empty directory.
	   [Do not make ANY changes to the files.]

	2. Use the command:
		cvs import -I linux-include \
			-m 'Virgin import of LBL traceroute v<version>' \
			src/contrib/traceroute LBL v<version>

	   For example, to do the import of version 1.3.2, I might have typed:
		cvs import -I linux-include \
			-m 'Virgin import of LBL traceroute v1.3.2' \
			src/contrib/traceroute LBL v1_3_2

	3. Follow the instructions printed out in step 2 to resolve any
	   conflicts between local FreeBSD changes and the newer version.

Do not, under any circumstances, deviate from this procedure.

To make local changes to traceroute, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the LBL branch.

All local changes should be submitted to "traceroute@ee.lbl.gov" for
inclusion in the next vendor release of traceroute.

(The "SANE_PRECISION" patch has been submitted and rejected.)

(The extensive modifications for TCP and GRE probes have not been
submitted.)
