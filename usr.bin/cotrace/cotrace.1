.Dt COTRACE 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cotrace
.Nd trace calls to capv services
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl C
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl v
.Fl i Ar index
.Ar command Op Ar args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to display
.Xr cocall 2
and
.Xr coaccept 2
interactions.
.Pp
XXX
.Pp
It spawns a child process passing it the capability vector modified
to interpose the service at offset
.Ar chosen
then executes
.Ar command .
The parent process transparently relays the calls.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl s time"
.It Fl C
Do not call
.Xr cap_enter 2 ;
thus do not enter
.Xr capsicum 4
capability mode.
.It Fl i
Interpose the service found at offset
.Ar index
in the capability vector inherited from the parent process.
.It Fl k
Use
.Xr coaccept_slow 2
instead of
.Xr coaccept 2 .
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
This also makes
.Nm
send its own answerback instead of relaying them.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
can be used as a template when implementing new
.Xr cocall 2
services, because it is small, straighforward,
.\" XXX I'm flat out lying here.
and even somewhat commented.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To trace a
.Xr clocks 1
service; notice the answerback from
.Xr capv 1 :
.Pp
.Dl clocks cotrace -vi5 sh
.Dl capv -v
.Dl date
