/**
 * struct xge_hal_stats_hw_info_t - Xframe hardware statistics.
 * Transmit MAC Statistics:
 *
 * @tmac_frms: Count of successfully transmitted MAC
 * frames Note that this statistic may be inaccurate. The correct statistic may
 * be derived by calcualating (tmac_ttl_octets - tmac_ttl_less_fb_octets) / 8
 *
 * @tmac_data_octets: Count of data and padding octets of successfully
 * transmitted frames.
 *
 * @tmac_drop_frms: Count of frames that could not be sent for no other reason
 * than internal MAC processing. Increments once whenever the
 * transmit buffer is flushed (due to an ECC error on a memory descriptor).
 *
 * @tmac_mcst_frms: Count of successfully transmitted frames to a multicast
 * address. Does not include frames sent to the broadcast address.
 *
 * @tmac_bcst_frms: Count of successfully transmitted frames to the broadcast
 * address.
 *
 * @tmac_pause_ctrl_frms: Count of MAC PAUSE control frames that are
 * transmitted. Since, the only control frames supported by this device
 * are PAUSE frames, this register is a count of all transmitted MAC control
 * frames.
 *
 * @tmac_ttl_octets: Count of total octets of transmitted frames, including
 * framing characters.
 *
 * @tmac_ucst_frms: Count of transmitted frames containing a unicast address.
 * @tmac_nucst_frms: Count of transmitted frames containing a non-unicast
 * (broadcast, multicast) address.
 *
 * @tmac_any_err_frms: Count of transmitted frames containing any error that
 * prevents them from being passed to the network. Increments if there is an ECC
 * while reading the frame out of the transmit buffer.
 *
 * @tmac_ttl_less_fb_octets: Count of total octets of transmitted
 * frames, not including framing characters (i.e. less framing bits)
 *
 * @tmac_vld_ip_octets: Count of total octets of transmitted IP datagrams that
 * were passed to the network. Frames that are padded by the host have
 * their padding counted as part of the IP datagram.
 *
 * @tmac_vld_ip: Count of transmitted IP datagrams that were passed to the
 * network.
 *
 * @tmac_drop_ip: Count of transmitted IP datagrams that could not be passed to
 * the network. Increments because of 1) an internal processing error (such as
 * an uncorrectable ECC error); 2) a frame parsing error during IP checksum
 * calculation.
 *
 * @tmac_icmp: Count of transmitted ICMP messages. Includes messages not sent
 * due to problems within ICMP.
 *
 * @tmac_rst_tcp: Count of transmitted TCP segments containing the RST flag.
 *
 * @tmac_tcp: Count of transmitted TCP segments. Note that Xena has
 * no knowledge of retransmission.
 *
 * @tmac_udp: Count of transmitted UDP datagrams.
 * @reserved_0: Reserved.
 *
 * Receive MAC Statistics:
 * @rmac_vld_frms: Count of successfully received MAC frames. Does not include
 * frames received with frame-too-long, FCS, or length errors.

 * multicast address. Does not include frames received with frame-too-long, FCS,
 * or length errors.

 * value between 46 (42 for VLANtagged frames) and 1500 (also 1500 for
 * VLAN-tagged frames), inclusive, that does not match the number of data octets
 * (including pad) received. Also contains a count of received frames with a
 * length/type field less than 46 (42 for VLAN-tagged frames) and the number of

 * prevents them from being passed to the system. Includes, for example,
