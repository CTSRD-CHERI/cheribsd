 *		 message communicates to the host the success or failure of the
 *		 corresponding STAG Invalidate Local Tag Request  message.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_STAG_BIND_MW_REQ: This downward message commands
 *		 the adapter to bind an existing (invalid) MW to an existing
 *		 (valid) MR.  This message provides an alternative to the TOWI
 *		 based implementation allowing the  path be used for MW binding
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_STAG_BIND_MW_RESP: This upward message
 *		 communicates to the host the success or failure of the
 *		 corresponding STAG Bind MW Request  message.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_STAG_FAST_REGISTER_NSMR_REQ: The STAG Fast
 *		 Register NSMR Request  provides an alternative way to fast
 *		 register an NSMR instead of going to the TOWI path.

 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_TCP_RELINK_TO_NCE_REQ:The TCP Relink to NCE
 *		 Request  would be used to change the NCE entry associated
 *		 with a particular bytestream or iWARP session. This message
 *		 could be used to change the NCE of a group of sessions if a
 *		 particular path went down and need to be replaced by a new path
 *		 The host is responsible for tracking the mapping of sessions to
 *		 NCEs so that when de-allocating an NCE it does not de-allocate
 *		 on that is still in use by a particular session.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_TCP_RELINK_TO_NCE_RESP:This message is sent in
 *		 response to the TCP Relink to NCE Request  to indicate the

 *		 Delete Request  to tell the adapter to stop steering Rx
 *		 frames from that session into the LRO path. The host would
 *		 later call LRO Delete Request . Separating these two calls
 *		 allows enough time to pass so that frames already in the FB can
 *		 be drained out, thereby avoiding the need for frame reversion.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_LRO_END_CLASSIF_RESP:The LRO End
 *		 Classification Response  message is sent in response to a

 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_LRO_DELETE_REQ:The LRO Delete Request
 *		 message is sent by the host to delete a LRO session on the
 *		 adapter.It might be possible in the future to replace this
 *		 message and the TCP Delete Request  with a single common
 *		 message since there doesn't seem to be any difference between
 *		 the two anymore.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_LRO_DELETE_RESP:The LRO Delete Response
 *		 message is sent in response to a LRO Delete Request  message
 *		 to indicate that the LRO session has been deleted.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_LRO_SESSION_CANDIDATE_NOTIF:This msg
 *		 indicates to the host that the adapter's autoLRO feature has
 *		 identified a candidate LRO session. No response from the host
 *		 is required. (If the host did decide to act on this information
 *		 from the adapter, the host would use the usual LRO Open Request
 *		).
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SPDM_OPEN_REQ:The SPDM Open Request  message
 *		 is sent by the host to open an SPDM connection on the adapter.
 *		 There is no RPE or PE context for an SPDM session. The ONE is
 *		 not involved in this type of classification.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SPDM_OPEN_RESP:The SPDM Open Response
 *		 message is sent in response to a SPDM Open Request  message
 *		 to indicate the status of creating the SPDM session.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SPDM_DELETE_REQ:The SPDM Delete Request
 *		 message is sent by the host to delete an SPDM session on the
 *		 adapter. It might be possible in the future to replace this
 *		 message and the LRO/TCP Delete Request  with a single common
 *		 message since there doesn't seem to be any difference between
 *		 the two anymore.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SPDM_DELETE_RESP:The SPDM Delete Response
 *		 message is sent in response to a SPDM Delete Request  message
 *		 to indicate that the SPDM session has been deleted.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SESSION_EVENT_NOTIF:The Session Event
 *		 Notification  message is an unsolicited message from the
 *		 adapter used to inform the host about an unexpected condition
 *		 on a bytestream or iWARP session.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SESSION_QUERY_REQ:The Session Query Request
 *		 message is sent by the host to query the attributes of an
 *		 existing offloaded session. This message may be used to query
 *		 the attributes of an SPDM, LRO, bytestream or iWARP session.
 *		 Initially this will be a single message used for all purposes.
 *		 In the future this may be split up into multiple messages
 *		 allowing the user to query the pecific context for an SPDM,
 *		 LRO, iWARP, or bytestream session.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SESSION_QUERY_RESP:The Session Query Response
 *		  message is sent in response to a Session Query Request
 *		 message to return the attributes associated with the specified
 *		 session
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SESSION_RETURN_IN_PROG_WQES: This message is
 *		 generated by the adapter during deletion of a session to return
 *		 any WQEs that may be in the in-progress list for the session.If
 *		 a WQE is in the in-progress list it is owned by the session and
 *		 cannot be returned to the head of WQE list for an SRQ because
 *		 of ordering issues. Therefore, it must be returned to the host
 *		 at which point the host may choose to destroy the resource or
 *		 simply re-post the WQE for re-use.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SESSION_FRAME_WRITE:The Frame Write  message is
 *		 generated by the adapter in order to send certain frames to the
 *		 host via the  path instead of the normal path. Frames will be
 *		 sent to the host under the following conditions:
 *		 1) mis-aligned frames that the adapter cannot place
 *		 2) during debugging to look at the contents of the frame
 *		 In addition to this,a RDMA terminate message will also be sent
 *		 via a  message but in this case it will be sent in a TCP RDMA
 *		 Terminate Received  message. Frames arriving in the  will
 *		 not have markers stripped. Instead the host will be responsible
 *		 for stripping markers and taking appropriate action on the
 *		 received frame.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SQ_CREATE_REQ: This is HAL private message for.
 *		 SQ create. Never used.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SQ_CREATE_RESP: This is HAL private message
 *		 for SQ create response. This is reported to clients by HAL.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SQ_DELETE_REQ: This is HAL private message for.
 *		 SQ delete. Never used.
 * @VXGE_HAL_MSG_TYPE_SQ_DELETE_RESP:This is HAL private message
 *		 for SQ delete response. This is reported to clients by HAL.
