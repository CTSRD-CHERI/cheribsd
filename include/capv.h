/*
 * Define conventions used for services using capv(6) framework.
 * Try to follow those, unless you really have a good reason not
 * to (and writing a replacement mechanism is just one example).
 * Or at least keep the size_t-sized length at the very beginning
 * of every output buffer passed to cocall(2).  You can compare
 * it with the size returned by cocall(2)/coaccept(2) to make sure
 * you actually received all the data.  Integer-sized opcode 0
 * that follows is reserved for answerback, for both calls and
 * returns; other values are left for application use.
 *
 * For an example of how to use it, see usr.bin/clocks/clocks.c
 * (service) and lib/libclocks/clocks.c (client).
