#
# Generic mechanism to deal with WITH and WITHOUT options and turn
# them into MK_ options.
#
# For each option FOO in __DEFAULT_YES_OPTIONS, MK_FOO is set to
# "yes", unless WITHOUT_FOO is defined, in which case it is set to
# "no".
#
# For each option FOO in __DEFAULT_NO_OPTIONS, MK_FOO is set to "no",
# unless WITH_FOO is defined, in which case it is set to "yes".
#
# For each entry FOO/BAR in __DEFAULT_DEPENDENT_OPTIONS,
# MK_FOO is set to "no" if WITHOUT_FOO is defined,
# "yes" if WITH_FOO is defined, otherwise the value of MK_BAR.
#
# If both WITH_FOO and WITHOUT_FOO are defined, WITHOUT_FOO wins and
# MK_FOO is set to "no" regardless of which list it was in.
#
# All of __DEFAULT_YES_OPTIONS, __DEFAULT_NO_OPTIONS and
# __DEFAULT_DEPENDENT_OPTIONS are undef'd after all this processing,
# allowing this file to be included multiple times with different lists.
#
# Other parts of the build system will set BROKEN_OPTIONS to a list
# of options that are broken on this platform. This will not be unset
# before returning. Clients are expected to always += this variable.
#
# Users should generally define WITH_FOO or WITHOUT_FOO, but the build
# system should use MK_FOO={yes,no} when it needs to override the
# user's desires or default behavior.
#
