.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexec
.Nd manipulate state of mac_veriexec
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl C Ar directory
.Pa manifest
.Nm
.Fl z Ar state
.Nm
.Fl i Ar state
.Nm
.Fl x
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility to query or manipulate the state of
.Xr mac_veriexec 4 .
.Pp
The first form is for loading a
.Pa manifest .
.Nm
first verifies a digital signature of the
.Ar manifest
and if successful, parses it and feeds its content to kernel.
.Pp
The second form with
.Fl z
is used to modify the
.Ar state ,
and with
.Fl i
to query the current
.Ar state .
.Pp
The final form with
.Fl x
is used to test whether
.Ar file
is verified or not.
This requires
.Xr mac_veriexec 4
to be in the
.Ql active
or
.Ql enforce
state.
.Pp
The possible states
are:
.Bl -tag -width enforce
.It Ar loaded
set automatically when first
.Pa manifest
has been loaded.
.It Ar active
.Xr mac_veriexec 4
will begin checking files.
This state can only be entered from the
.Ar loaded
state.
.It Ar enforce
.Xr mac_veriexec 4
will fail attempts to
.Xr exec 2
or
.Xr open 2
files with
.Dv O_VERIFY
unless verified.
.It Ar locked
prevent loading of any more manifests.
.El
.Sh MANIFESTS
The manifest contains a mapping of relative pathnames to fingerprints
with optional flags.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sbin/veriexec sha256=f22136...c0ff71 no_ptrace
usr/bin/python sha256=5944d9...876525 indirect
sbin/somedaemon sha256=77fc2f...63f5687 label=mod1/val1,mod2/val2
.Ed
The supported flags are:
.Bl -tag -width indirect
.It Ql indirect
the executable cannot be run directly,
but can be used as an interpreter for example via:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/usr/bin/python
.Ed
.It Ql no_ptrace
do not allow running executable under a debugger.
Useful for any application critical to the security state of system.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ql label
argument allows associating a
.Xr maclabel 7
with the executable.
Neither
.Nm
nor
.Xr mac_veriexec 4
(if it supports labels)
pay any attention to the content of the label
they are provided for the use of other
.Xr mac 4
modules.
.Sh HISTORY
The Verified Exec system first appeared in NetBSD.
This utility derrives from the one found in Junos.
The key difference is the requirement that manifest files
be digitally signed.
