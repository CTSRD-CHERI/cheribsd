	 * Locking semantics:
	 *
	 * Functions implementing the icbus interface that interact
	 * with the controller acquire an exclusive lock on call_lock
	 * to prevent interleaving of calls to the interface and a lock on
	 * io_lock right afterwards, to synchronize controller I/O activity.
	 *
	 * The interrupt handler can only read data while no iicbus call
	 * is in progress or while io_lock is dropped during mtx_sleep in
	 * wait_status and set_controller. It is safe to drop io_lock in those
	 * places, because the interrupt handler only accesses those registers:
	 *
	 * - IG4_REG_I2C_STA  (I2C Status)
	 * - IG4_REG_DATA_CMD (Data Buffer and Command)
	 * - IG4_REG_CLR_INTR (Clear Interrupt)
	 *
	 * Locking outside of those places is required to make the content
	 * of rpos/rnext predictable (e.g. whenever data_read is called and in
	 * ig4iic_transfer).
