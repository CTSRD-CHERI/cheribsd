/*
 * A PowerPC MMU implementation is declared with a kernel object and
 * an associated method table. The MMU_DEF macro is used to declare
 * the class, and also links it to the global MMU class list.
 *
 * e.g.
 *
 * static mmu_method_t ppc8xx_methods[] = {
 *	MMUMETHOD(mmu_change_wiring,		ppc8xx_mmu_change_wiring),
 *	MMUMETHOD(mmu_clear_modify,		ppc8xx_mmu_clear_modify),
 *	MMUMETHOD(mmu_clear_reference,		ppc8xx_mmu_clear_reference),
 *  ...
 *	MMUMETHOD(mmu_dev_direct_mapped,	ppc8xx_mmu_dev_direct_mapped),
 *	{ 0, 0 }
 * };
 *
 * MMU_DEF(ppc8xx, MMU_TYPE_8xx, ppc8xx_methods, sizeof(ppc8xx_mmu_softc));
 *
 * A single level of inheritance is supported in a similar fashion to
 * kobj inheritance e.g.
 *
 * MMU_DEF_1(ppc860c, MMU_TYPE_860c, ppc860c_methods, 0, ppc8xx);
