FreeBSD is an operating system used to power modern servers,
desktops, and embedded platforms. A large community has
continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its
advanced networking, security, and storage features have
made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the
busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking
and storage devices.
