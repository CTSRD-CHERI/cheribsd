    These firmware should be put under /lib/firmware/rtw88/
    And note that the rtw88 driver is able to support wake-on-wireless LAN
    for RTL8822C devices, after kernel v5.6+. So, make sure the firmware
    rtw88/rtw8822c_wow_fw.bin is also packed, otherwise the firmware load
    fail could be a problem.
    Although RTL8723D devices are 802.11n device, they are also supported
    by rtw88 because the hardware arch is similar.
