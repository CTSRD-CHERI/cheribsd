.Sh NAME
.Nm rcp
.Nd remote file copy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46p
.Ar file1 file2
.Nm
.Op Fl 46pr
.Ar
.Ar directory
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
.Nm
is deprecated and will be removed from future versions of the
.Fx
base system.
If
.Nm
is still required, it can be installed from ports or packages
(net/bsdrcmds).
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility copies files between machines.
Each
.Ar file
or
.Ar directory
argument is either a remote file name of the
form
.Dq ruser@rhost:path ,
or a local file name (containing no
.Ql :\&
characters,
or a
.Ql /
before any
.Ql :\& Ns
s).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl p
Cause
.Nm
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
.Xr umask 2 .
By default, the mode and owner of
.Ar file2
are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
.Xr umask 2
on the destination host is used.
.It Fl r
If any of the source files are directories,
.Nm
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar path
is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to
the login directory of the specified user
.Ar ruser
on
.Ar rhost ,
or your current user name if no other remote user name is specified.
A
.Ar path
on a remote host may be quoted (using
.Ql \e ,
.Ql \&" ,
or
.Ql \(aa )
so that the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote execution
via
.Xr rsh 1 ,
and requires the same authorization.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files
are on the current machine.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr ftp 1 ,
.Xr rlogin 1 ,
.Xr rsh 1 ,
.Xr hosts.equiv 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
The version of
.Nm
described here
has been reimplemented with Kerberos in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
.Sh BUGS
Does not detect all cases where the target of a copy might
be a file in cases where only a directory should be legal.
.Pp
Is confused by any output generated by commands in a
.Pa .login ,
.Pa .profile ,
or
.Pa .cshrc
file on the remote host.
.Pp
The destination user and hostname may have to be specified as
.Dq rhost.ruser
when the destination machine is running the
.Bx 4.2
version of
.Nm .
