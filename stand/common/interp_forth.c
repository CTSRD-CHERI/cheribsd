 * Replace a word definition (a builtin command) with another

 *
 *        - Throw error results instead of returning them on the stack
 *        - Pass a flag indicating whether the word was compiled or is
 *          being interpreted.
 *
 * There is one major problem with builtins that cannot be overcome
 * in anyway, except by outlawing it. We want builtins to behave
 * differently depending on whether they have been compiled or they
 * are being interpreted. Notice that this is *not* the interpreter's
 * current state. For example:
 *
 * : example ls ; immediate
 * : problem example ;		\ "ls" gets executed while compiling
 * example			\ "ls" gets executed while interpreting
 *
 * Notice that, though the current state is different in the two
 * invocations of "example", in both cases "ls" has been
 * *compiled in*, which is what we really want.
 *
 * The problem arises when you tick the builtin. For example:
 *
 * : example-1 ['] ls postpone literal ; immediate
 * : example-2 example-1 execute ; immediate
 * : problem example-2 ;
 * example-2
 *
 * We have no way, when we get EXECUTEd, of knowing what our behavior
 * should be. Thus, our only alternative is to "outlaw" this. See RFI
 * 0007, and ANS Forth Standard's appendix D, item 6.7 for a related
 * problem, concerning compile semantics.
 *
 * The problem is compounded by the fact that "' builtin CATCH" is valid
 * and desirable. The only solution is to create an intermediary word.
 * For example:
 *
 * : my-ls ls ;
 * : example ['] my-ls catch ;
 *
 * So, with the below implementation, here is a summary of the behavior
 * of builtins:
 *
 * ls -l				\ "interpret" behavior, ie,
 *					\ takes parameters from TIB
 * : ex-1 s" -l" 1 ls ;			\ "compile" behavior, ie,
 *					\ takes parameters from the stack
 * : ex-2 ['] ls catch ; immediate	\ undefined behavior
 * : ex-3 ['] ls catch ;		\ undefined behavior
 * ex-2 ex-3				\ "interpret" behavior,
 *					\ catch works
 * : ex-4 ex-2 ;			\ "compile" behavior,
 *					\ catch does not work
 * : ex-5 ex-3 ; immediate		\ same as ex-2
 * : ex-6 ex-3 ;			\ same as ex-3
 * : ex-7 ['] ex-1 catch ;		\ "compile" behavior,
 *					\ catch works
 * : ex-8 postpone ls ;	immediate	\ same as ex-2
 * : ex-9 postpone ls ;			\ same as ex-3
 *
 * As the definition below is particularly tricky, and it's side effects
 * must be well understood by those playing with it, I'll be heavy on
 * the comments.
 *
 * (if you edit this definition, pay attention to trailing spaces after
 *  each word -- I warned you! :-) )
