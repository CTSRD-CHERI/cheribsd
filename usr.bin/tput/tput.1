.Sh NAME
.Nm tput ,
.Nm clear
.Nd terminal capability interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Ar attribute ...
.Nm clear
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility makes terminal-dependent information available to users or shell
applications.
When invoked as the
.Nm clear
utility, the screen will be cleared as if
.Dl tput clear
had been executed.
The options to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T
The terminal name as specified in the
.Xr termcap 5
database, for example,
.Dq vt100
or
.Dq xterm .
If not specified,
.Nm
retrieves the
.Dq Ev TERM
variable from the environment.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility outputs a string for each
.Ar attribute
that is of type string; a number for each of type integer.
Otherwise,
.Nm
exits 0 if the terminal has the capability and 1 if it does not,
without further action.
.Pp
If an
.Ar attribute
is of type string, and takes arguments (e.g.\& cursor movement,
the termcap
.Dq cm
sequence) the arguments are taken from the command line immediately
following the attribute.
.Pp
The following special attributes are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Cm clear
Clear the screen (the
.Xr termcap 5
.Dq cl
sequence).
.It Cm init
Initialize the terminal (the
.Xr termcap 5
.Dq is
sequence).
.It Cm longname
Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.
.It Cm reset
Reset the terminal (the
.Xr termcap 5
.Dq rs
sequence).
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The exit status of
.Nm
is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 0
If the last attribute
.Ar attribute
argument is of type string or integer, its value was successfully written
to standard output.
If the argument is of type boolean, the terminal has this attribute.
.It 1
This terminal does not have the specified boolean
.Ar attribute .
.It 2
Usage error.
.It 3
No information is available about the specified terminal type.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr termcap 5 ,
.Xr terminfo 5
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility cannot really distinguish between different types of attributes.
.Pp
Some termcap entries depend upon having a
.Sq %
in them that is just a
.Sq %
and nothing more.
Right now we just warn about them if they do not
have a valid type declaration.
These warnings are sent to
stderr.
