.Sh NAME
.Nm dpt
.Nd DPT RAID Controller SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device dpt"
.Pp
For one or more PCI cards:
.Cd "device pci"
.Pp
To allow PCI adapters to use memory mapped I/O if enabled:
.Cd options DPT_ALLOW_MEMIO
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dpt_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports DPT RAID SCSI controllers.
.Pp
SmartRAID (PM3???) are "Enterprise" class cards,
and SmartCache (PM2???) cards are in the "Workstation" class.
The Gen 4 Smart Cache IV products were a re-issue of the Gen 3 utilizing
upgraded (and cheaper to produce) silicon.
The PM3334 (Smart RAID III) was not revamped as there was no upgraded silicon
(68040 processor) and it was using the best DPT made.
Note there has been customer confusion over the faster enterprise class card
supported by this driver being an older generation.
The Gen5 cards are supported by the
.Xr asr 4
driver.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the following RAID adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
DPT Smart Cache Plus
.It
Smart Cache II (PM2?2?, PM2024/PM2124 [PCI]) (Gen2)
.It
Smart RAID II (PM3?2?, PM3021, PM3222)
.It
Smart Cache III (PM2?3?)
.It
Smart RAID III (PM3?3?, PM3334UW [PCI]) (Gen3)
.It
Smart Cache IV (PM2?4?, PM2044/PM2144 [PCI]) (Gen4)
.It
Smart RAID IV
