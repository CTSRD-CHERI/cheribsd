description: |
  The Bus Clock Manager (BCM) is a dedicated hardware accelerator that manages
  shared system resources by aggregating requests from multiple Resource State
  Coordinators (RSC). Interconnect providers are able to vote for aggregated
  thresholds values from consumers by communicating through their respective
  RSCs.
