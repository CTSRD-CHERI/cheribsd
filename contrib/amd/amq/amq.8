.Op Fl fimpqsvwHTU
.Op Fl h Ar hostname
.Op Fl l Ar log_file
.Op Fl x Ar log_options
.Op Fl D Ar debug_options
.Op Fl P Ar program_number
.Op Oo Fl u Oc Ar directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This command is obsolete.
Users are advised to use
.Xr autofs 5
instead.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
provides a simple way of determining the current state of the
.Xr amd 8
program.
Communication is by
.Tn RPC .
Three modes of operation are supported by the current protocol.
By default
a list of mount points and auto-mounted file systems is output.
An
alternative host can be specified using the
.Fl h
option.
.Pp
If
.Ar directory
names are given, as output by default, then per file system
information is displayed.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Ask the automounter to flush the internal caches and reload all the maps.
.It Fl h Ar hostname
Specify an alternate host to query.
By default the local host is used.
In
an
.Tn HP-UX
cluster, the root server is queried by default, since that is the system on
which the automounter is normally run.
.TP
.It Fl i
Print information about the mount maps.
.TP
.It Fl l Ar log_file
Tell
.Xr amd 8
to use
.Ar log_file
as the log file name.
For security reasons, this must be the same log file
which
.Xr amd 8
used when started.
This option is therefore only useful to
refresh
.Nm amd Ns 's
open file handle on the log file, so that it can be rotated
and compressed via daily cron jobs.
.It Fl m
Ask the automounter to provide a list of mounted file systems, including the
number of references to each file system and any error which occurred while
mounting.
.It Fl p
Return the process ID of the remote or locally running
.Xr amd 8 .
Useful when you
need to send a signal to the local
.Xr amd 8
process, and would rather not have to
search through the process table.
This option is used in the
.Pa ctl-amd
script.
.TP
.It Fl q
Suppress error messages produced when attempting synchronous unmounts
with the
.B \-u
option.
.TP
.It Fl s
Ask the automounter to provide system-wide mount statistics.
.It Fl u
Ask the automounter to unmount the file systems named in
.Ar directory
instead of providing
information about them.
Unmounts are requested, not forced.
They merely
cause the mounted file system to timeout, which will be picked up by
.Nm amd Ns 's
main scheduler thus causing the normal timeout action to be taken.
If the
.B \-u
option is repeated,
.B amq
will attempt to unmount the file system synchronously by waiting until
the timeout action is taken and returning an error if the unmount
fails.
Any error messages produced may be suppressed with the
.B \-q
option.
.TP
.It Fl v
Ask the automounter for its version information.  This is a subset of the
information output by
.Xr amd 8 Ns 's
.Fl v
option.
.It Fl w
Translate a full pathname as returned by
.Xr getcwd 3
into a short
.Xr amd 8
pathname that goes through its mount points.
This option requires that
.Xr amd 8
is running.
.It Fl x Ar log_options
Ask the automounter to use the logging options specified in
.Ar log_options
from now on.  Note that the "fatal" and "error" options cannot be turned
off.
.It Fl D Ar debug_options
.BI \-D " debug_options"
Ask the automounter to use the debugging options specified in
.Ar debug_options
from now on.
.It Fl H
Display short usage message.
.It Fl P Ar program_number
Contact an alternate running
.Xr amd 8
that had registered itself on a different
.Tn RPC
.Ar program_number
and apply all other operations to that instance of the automounter.
This is
useful when you run multiple copies of
.Xr amd 8 ,
and need to manage each
one separately.
If not specified,
.Nm
will use the default program number for
.Xr amd 8 ,
300019.
For security reasons, the only alternate program numbers
.Xr amd 8
can use range from 300019 to 300029, inclusive.
.It Fl T
Contact
.Xr amd 8
using the TCP transport only.
Normally
.Nm
will try TCP, and if that failed, will try UDP.
.It Fl U
Contact
.Xr amd 8
using UDP (connectionless) transport only.
Normally
.Nm
will try TCP, and if that failed, will try UDP.

protocol description.

.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
utility
uses a Sun registered
.Tn RPC
program number (300019 decimal) which may not
be in the
.Xr rpc 5
database.
.Pp
If the TCP wrappers library is available, and the
.Va use_tcpwrappers
global
.Xr amd.conf 5
option is set to
.Dq Li yes ,
then
.Xr amd 8
will verify that the host running
.Nm
is authorized to connect.
The
.Dq Li amd
service name must be used in the
.Pa /etc/hosts.allow
and
.Pa /etc/hosts.deny
files.
For example, to allow only localhost to connect to
.Xr amd 8 ,
add this line to
.Pa /etc/hosts.allow :
.Pp
.Dl "amd: localhost"
.Pp
and this line to
.Pa /etc/hosts.deny :
.Pp
.RS
.Dl "amd: ALL"
