.Dt ZFSLOADER 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm zfsloader
.Nd kernel bootstrapping final stage
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an extended variant of
.Xr loader 8
with added support for booting from ZFS.
This document describes only differences from
.Xr loader 8 .
.Sh ZFS FEATURES
.Nm
supports the following format for specifying ZFS filesystems which
can be used wherever
.Xr loader 8
refers to a device specification:
.Pp
.Ar zfs:pool/filesystem:
.Pp
where
.Pa pool/filesystem
is a ZFS filesystem name as described in
.Xr zfs 8 .
.Pp
If
.Pa /etc/fstab
does not have an entry for the root filesystem and
.Va vfs.root.mountfrom
is not set, but
.Va currdev
refers to a ZFS filesystem, then
.Nm
will instruct kernel to use that filesystem as the root filesystem.
.Sh ZFS COMMAND EXTENSIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic lsdev Op Fl v
Lists ZFS pools in addition to disks and partitions.
Adding
.Fl v
shows more ZFS pool details in a format that resembles
.Nm zpool Cm status
output.
.Pp
.It Ic lszfs Ar filesystem
A ZFS extended command that can be used to explore the ZFS filesystem
hierarchy in a pool.
Lists the immediate children of the
.Ar filesystem .
The filesystem hierarchy is rooted at a filesystem with the same name
as the pool.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /boot/zfsloader -compact
.It Pa /boot/zfsloader
.Nm
itself.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Set the default device used for loading a kernel from a ZFS filesystem:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set currdev=zfs:tank/ROOT/knowngood:
