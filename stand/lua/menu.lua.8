.Sh NAME
.Nm menu.lua
.Nd FreeBSD dynamic menu boot module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
contains the main functionality required to build a dynamic menu system.
It also contains definitions for the built-in menus, some of which are
influenced by
.Xr loader 8
environment variables.
.Pp
Before hooking into the functionality provided by
.Nm ,
it must be included with a statement such as the following:
.Pp
.Dl local menu = require("menu")
.Ss MENU DEFINITIONS
Menus are represented in
.Nm
as a table.
That table
.Sy must
contain an
.Va entries
key.
.Pp
If the value of the
.Va entries
key is itself a table, then each value in this table defines a single entry in
this menu.
See
.Sx MENU ITEM DEFINITIONS
for the structure of each entry.
.Pp
.Va entries
may also be a function.
This function must return a table, each value of which defines a single entry
in this menu.
See
.Sx MENU ITEM DEFINITIONS .
.Ss MENU ITEM DEFINITIONS
The following keys may be defined for a menu item:
.Bl -tag -width disable-module_module -offset indent
.It Ic entry_type
The type of this menu entry.
See
.Sx MENU ITEM TYPES .
.It Ic carousel_id
A unique string id for this carousel.
A carousel is a menu entry that rotates through a selection of items.
Used for storage of the carousel's current setting.
.It Ic visible
A lambda that returns
.Dv true
if this menu item should be visible and
.Dv false
if it should not be visible.
.It Ic items
A table (or a lambda that returns a table) of the possible choices for this
carousel.
.It Ic name
A string (or a lambda that returns a string) containing the current name of this
item.
.It Ic func
The function executed when this entry is selected.
Every type except for
.Ic core.MENU_SEPARATOR
may have a
.Ic func .
.It Ic submenu
The submenu menu definition to draw when this entry is selected.
.It Ic alias
A table of case-sensitive aliases for this menu entry.
All menu entries that can be selected may have any number of
.Ic alias
entries.
.El
.Pp
.Ic entry_type
is the only required key for every entry type.
.Ic name
is required for all entry types except for
.Ic core.MENU_SEPARATOR .
.Ss MENU ITEM TYPES
The menu item type constants are defined in
.Xr core.lua 8 .
The following types are available:
.Bl -tag -width core.MENU_CAROUSEL_ENTRY -offset indent
.It Ic core.MENU_RETURN
Return to the parent menu.
If the current menu is the default menu,
.Nm
will exit the menu and begin the autoboot sequence (if applicable).
This type of menu entry may execute
.Ic func ,
when selected, and has a
.Ic name .
.It Ic core.MENU_ENTRY
A normal menu entry that executes
.Ic func
when selected, and has a
.Ic name .
.It Ic core.MENU_SEPARATOR
A menu entry that serves as a separator.
It may have a
.Ic name .
.It Ic core.MENU_SUBMENU
A menu entry that opens
.Ic submenu
when selected.
It may have a
.Ic name .
.It Ic core.MENU_CAROUSEL_ENTRY
A menu entry that rotates through
.Ic items
like a carousel.
.Ic func
is executed when selected, and the callback is passed the choice index, name of
the current choice, and the table of choices.
.El
.Ss EXPORTED MENUS
The following menus are exported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width menu.boot_environments -offset indent
.It Ic menu.default
The default menu to draw.
Set to
.Ic menu.welcome
by default.
.It Ic menu.welcome
The welcome menu.
Contains single and multi user boot options, as well as entries to access other
menus.
.It Ic menu.boot_options
The "Boot Options" menu.
.It Ic menu.boot_environments
The "Boot Environments" menu.
This menu is only visible if the system is booted on a ZFS partition and more
than one boot environment was detected at boot.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To replace the default boot menu with a simple boot menu:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
local core = require("core")
local menu = require("menu")

menu.default = {
	entries = {
		{
			entry_type = core.MENU_ENTRY,
			name = "Boot",
			func = core.boot,
		},
		{
			entry_type = core.MENU_CAROUSEL_ENTRY,
			carousel_id = "unique_boot_entry_name",
			items = {"NO", "YES"},
			name = function(_, choice, _)
				return "Option: " .. choice
			end,
			func = function(_, _, _)
				loader.setenv("some_envvar", "some_value")
			end,
		},
	},
}
.Ed
.Pp
To add another option to the welcome menu:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
local core = require("core")
local menu = require("menu")

local welcome_entries = menu.welcome.all_entries
welcome_entries[#welcome_entries + 1] = {
	entry_type = core.MENU_CAROUSEL_ENTRY,
	carousel_id = "unique_boot_entry_name",
	items = {"NO", "YES"},
	name = function(_, choice, _)
		return "Option: " .. choice
	end,
	func = function(_, _, _)
		loader.setenv("some_envvar", "some_value")
	end,
}
