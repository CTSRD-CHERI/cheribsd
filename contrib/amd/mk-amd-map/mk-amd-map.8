.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl p
.Ar mapname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
creates the database maps used by the keyed map lookups in
.Xr amd 8 .
It reads input from the named file
and outputs them to a correspondingly named
hashed database.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
option prints the map on standard output instead of generating
a database.
This is usually used to merge continuation lines
into one physical line.
