.Sh DESCRIPTION
The DTrace
.Nm lockstat
provider allows the tracing of events related to locking on
.Fx .
.Pp
The
.Nm lockstat
provider contains DTrace probes for inspecting the kernel's lock
state transitions.
Probes exist for the
.Xr mutex 9 ,
.Xr rwlock 9
and
.Xr sx 9
lock types.
The
.Xr lockstat 1
utility can be used to collect and display data collected from the
.Nm lockstat
provider.
Each type of lock has
.Fn acquire
and
.Fn release
probes which expose the lock structure being operated upon,
as well as probes which fire when a thread contends with other threads
for ownership of a lock.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::adaptive-acquire
and
.Fn lockstat:::adaptive-release
probes fire when an
.Dv MTX_DEF
.Xr mutex 9
is acquired and released, respectively.
The only argument is a pointer to the lock structure which describes
the lock being acquired or released.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::adaptive-spin
probe fires when a thread spins while waiting for a
.Dv MTX_DEF
.Xr mutex 9
to be released by another thread.
The first argument is a pointer to the lock structure that describes
the lock and the second argument is the amount of time,
in nanoseconds, that the mutex spent spinning.
The
.Fn lockstat:::adaptive-block
probe fires when a thread takes itself off the CPU while trying to acquire an
.Dv MTX_DEF
.Xr mutex 9
that is owned by another thread.
The first argument is a pointer to the lock structure that describes
the lock and the second argument is the length of time,
in nanoseconds, that the waiting thread was blocked.
The
.Fn lockstat:::adaptive-block
and
.Fn lockstat:::adaptive-spin
probes fire only after the lock has been successfully acquired,
and in particular, after the
.Fn lockstat:::adaptive-acquire
probe fires.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::spin-acquire
and
.Fn lockstat:::spin-release
probes fire when a
.Dv MTX_SPIN
.Xr mutex 9
is acquired and released, respectively.
The only argument is a pointer to the lock structure which describes
the lock being acquired or released.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::spin-spin
probe fires when a thread spins while waiting for a
.Dv MTX_SPIN
.Xr mutex 9
to be released by another thread.
The first argument is a pointer to the lock structure that describes
the lock and the second argument is the length of the time
spent spinning, in nanoseconds.
The
.Fn lockstat:::spin-spin
probe fires only after the lock has been successfully acquired,
and in particular, after the
.Fn lockstat:::spin-acquire
probe fires.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::rw-acquire
and
.Fn lockstat:::rw-release
probes fire when a
.Xr rwlock 9
is acquired and released, respectively.
The first argument is a pointer to the structure which describes
the lock being acquired.
The second argument is
.Dv 0
if the lock is being acquired or released as a writer, and
.Dv 1
if it is being acquired or released as a reader.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::rw-block
probe fires when a thread removes itself from the CPU while
waiting to acquire a
.Xr rwlock 9 .
The
.Fn lockstat:::rw-spin
probe fires when a thread spins while waiting to acquire a
.Xr rwlock 9 .
Both probes take the same set of arguments.
The first argument is a pointer to the lock structure that describes
the lock.
The second argument is the length of time, in nanoseconds,
that the waiting thread was off the CPU or spinning for the lock.
The third argument is
.Dv 0
if the thread is attempting to acquire the lock as a writer, and
.Dv 1
if the thread is attempting to acquire the lock as a reader.
The fourth argument is
.Dv 0
if the thread is waiting for a writer to release the lock, and
.Dv 1
if the thread is waiting for a reader to release the lock.
The fifth argument is the number of readers that held the lock when
the thread first attempted to acquire the lock.
This argument will be
.Dv 0
if the fourth argument is
.Dv 0 .
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::rw-upgrade
probe fires when a thread successfully upgrades a held
.Xr rwlock 9
read lock to a write lock.
The
.Fn lockstat:::rw-downgrade
probe fires when a thread downgrades a held
.Xr rwlock 9
write lock to a read lock.
The only argument is a pointer to the structure which describes
the lock being acquired.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::sx-acquire
and
.Fn lockstat:::sx-release
probes fire when a
.Xr sx 9
is acquired and released, respectively.
The first argument is a pointer to the structure which describes
the lock being acquired.
The second argument is
.Dv 0
if the shared lock is being acquired or released, and
.Dv 1
if the exclusive lock is being acquired or released.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::sx-block
probe fires when a thread takes itself off the CPU while
waiting to acquire a
.Xr sx 9 .
The
.Fn lockstat:::sx-spin
probe fires when a thread spins while waiting to acquire a
.Xr sx 9 .
Both probes take the same set of arguments.
The first argument is a pointer to the lock structure that describes
the lock.
The second argument is the length of time, in nanoseconds,
that the waiting thread was off the CPU or spinning for the lock.
The third argument is
.Dv 0
if the thread is attempting to acquire the lock as a writer, and
.Dv 1
if the thread is attempting to acquire the lock as a reader.
The fourth argument is
.Dv 0
if the thread is waiting for a writer to release the lock, and
.Dv 1
if the thread is waiting for a reader to release the lock.
The fifth argument is the number of readers that held the lock when
the thread first attempted to acquire the lock.
This argument will be
.Dv 0
if the fourth argument is
.Dv 0 .
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::sx-upgrade
probe fires when a thread successfully upgrades a held
.Xr sx 9
shared lock to an exclusive lock.
The only argument is a pointer to the structure which describes
the lock being acquired.
The
.Fn lockstat:::sx-downgrade
probe fires when a thread downgrades a held
.Xr sx 9
exclusive lock to a shared lock.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstat:::thread-spin
probe fires when a thread spins on a thread lock, which is a specialized
.Dv MTX_SPIN
.Xr mutex 9 .
The first argument is a pointer to the structure that describes
the lock and the second argument is the length of time,
in nanoseconds, that the thread was spinning.
