1.0		1/24/97	   First Alpha release

1.1		2/20/97	   Added video ioctl so we can do PCI To PCI
			   data transfers. This is for capturing data
			   directly to a vga frame buffer which has
			   a linear frame buffer. Minor code clean-up.

1.3		2/23/97	   Fixed system lock-up reported by 
			   Randall Hopper <rhh@ct.picker.com>. This
			   problem seems somehow to be exhibited only
			   in his system. I changed the setting of
			   INT_MASK for CAP_CONTINUOUS to be exactly
			   the same as CAP_SINGLE apparently setting
			   bit 23 cleared the system lock up. 
			   version 1.1 of the driver has been reported
			   to work with STB's WinTv, Hauppage's Wincast/Tv
			   and last but not least with the Intel Smart
			   Video Recorder.

1.4		3/9/97	   fsmp@freefall.org

1.19            9/8/97     improved yuv support , cleaned up weurope
                           channel table, incorporated cleanup work from
                           Luigi, fixed pci interface bug due to a
                           change in the pci interface which disables
                           interrupts from a PCI device by default,

                           some bt848 based cards;additionally, wrote code to
                           correctly recognized his bt848 card.
                           Roger Hardiman <roger@cs.strath.ac.uk> submitted 
                           various fixes to smooth out the microcode and made 
                           all modes consistent.
1.26                       Moved Luigi's I2CWR ioctl from the video_ioctl
                           section to the tuner_ioctl section
                           Changed Major device from 79 to 92 and reserved
                           our Major device number -- hasty@star-gate.com
1.27                       Last batch of patches for radio support from

                           Tomi Vainio <tomppa@fidata.fi>
1.28                       Frank Nobis <fn@Radio-do.de> added tuner support
                           for the  German Phillips PAL tuner and
                           additional channels for german cable tv.
1.29                       Roger Hardiman <roger@cs.strath.ac.uk>
                           Revised autodetection code to correctly handle both
                           old and new VideoLogic Captivator PCI cards.
                           Added tsleep of 2 seconds to initialistion code
                           for PAL users.Corrected clock selection code on
                           format change.
1.30                       Bring back Frank Nobis <fn@Radio-do.de>'s opt_bktr.h

1.31                       Randall Hopper <rhh@ct.picker.com>
                           submitted ioctl to clear the video buffer
                           prior to starting video capture
			   Amancio : clean up yuv12 so that it does not
                           affect rgb capture. Basically, fxtv after
                           capturing in yuv12 mode , switching to rgb
                           would cause the video capture to be too bright.
1.32                       disable inverse gamma function for rgb and yuv
                           capture. fixed meteor brightness ioctl it now
                           converts the brightness value from unsigned to 
                           signed.
1.33                       added sysctl: hw.bt848.tuner, hw.bt848.reverse_mute,
                           hw.bt848.card
			   card takes a value from 0 to bt848_max_card
                           tuner takes a value from 0 to bt848_max_tuner
                           reverse_mute : 0 no effect, 1 reverse tuner
                           mute function some tuners are wired reversed :(
1.34                       reverse mute function for ims turbo card

1.35                       Roger Hardiman <roger@cs.strath.ac.uk>
                           options BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_PAL
                           in the kernel config file makes the driver's
                           video_open() function select PAL rather than NTSC.
                           This fixed all the hangs on my Dual Crystal card
                           when using a PAL video signal. As a result, you
                           can lose the tsleep (of 2 seconds - now 0.25!!)
                           which I previously added. (Unless someone else
                           wanted the 0.25 second tsleep).

1.36                       added bt848.format sysctl variable. 
                           1 denotes NTSC , 0 denotes PAL

1.37                       added support for Bt878 and improved Hauppauge's
                           bt848 tuner recognition
1.38                       Further improvements on Hauppauge's rely on
                           eeprom[9] to determine the tuner type 8)

                           AVerMedia card type added <sos@freebsd.org>

1.39            08/05/98   Roger Hardiman <roger@cs.strath.ac.uk>
                           Updated Hauppauge detection code for Tuner ID 0x0a 
                           for newer NTSC WinCastTV 404 with Bt878 chipset.
                           Tidied up PAL default in video_open()

			   Soren bumped version from 1.39 to 1.49 to sync
                           with FreeBSD CVS numbers.

1.49       10 August 1998  Roger Hardiman <roger@cs.strath.ac.uk>
                           Added Capture Area ioctl - BT848[SG]CAPAREA.
                           Normally the full 640x480 (768x576 PAL) image
                           is grabbed. This ioctl allows a smaller area
                           from anywhere within the video image to be
                           grabbed, eg a 400x300 image from (50,10).
                           See restrictions in BT848SCAPAREA.

1.50       31 August 1998  Roger Hardiman <roger@cs.strath.ac.uk>
                           Renamed BT848[SG]CAPAREA to BT848_[SG]CAPAREA.
                           Added PR kern/7177 for SECAM Video Highway Xtreme
                           with single crystal PLL configuration
                           submitted by Vsevolod Lobko <seva@alex-ua.com>.
                           In kernel configuration file add
                             options OVERRIDE_CARD=2
                             options OVERRIDE_TUNER=11
                             options BKTR_USE_PLL

1.51       31 August 1998  Roger Hardiman <roger@cs.strath.ac.uk>
                           Fixed bug in Miro Tuner detection. Missing Goto.
                           Removed Hauppauge EEPROM 0x10 detection as I think
			   0x10 should be a PAL tuner, not NTSC.
			   Reinstated some Tuner Guesswork code from 1.27

1.57    26 Jan 1999 Roger Hardiman <roger@cs.strath.ac.uk>
                    Support for MSP3410D / MSP3415D Stereo/Mono audio
                    using the audio format Auto Detection Mode.
                    Nicolas Souchu <nsouch@freebsd.org> ported the
                    msp_read/write/reset functions to smbus/iicbus.
                    METEOR_INPUT_DEV2 now selects a composite camera on
                    the SVIDEO port for Johan Larsson<gozer@ludd.luth.se>
                    For true SVIDEO, use METEOR_INPUT_DEV_SVIDEO

                    Added initial code for VBI capture based on work by
                    Hiroki Mori <mori@infocity.co.jp> and reworked by myself.
                    This allows software decoding of teletext, intercast and
                    subtitles via /dev/vbi.

1.64     7 May 1999 Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org>
                    Support LifeView FlyVideo 98 cards. Use EEPROM for card
                    autodetection. Use bttv's audio mux values.
                      Thanks to Paul Reece <paul@fastlane.net.au>,
                              Ivan Brawley <brawley@internode.com.au> and
                              Gilad Rom <rom_glsa@ein-hashofet.co.il>
		    Automatically locate the EEPROM i2c address and read the
		    subsystem_vendor_id from EEPROM and not the PCI registers.
                    Add NSMBUS checks around smbus/iicbus i2c bus code
                    making it easier to compile the driver under 2.2.x.
                    Add GPIO mask for the audio mux to each card type.
                    Add CARD_ZOLTRIX and CARD_KISS from mailing list searches.

1.65    18 May 1999 Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org>
                    Change Intel GPIO mask to stop turning the Intel Camera off
                    Fixed tuner selection on Hauppauge card with tuner 0x0a
                    Replaced none tuner with no tuner for Theo de Raadt.
                    Ivan Brawley <brawley@internode.com.au> added
                    the Australian channel frequencies.

1.66    19 May 1999 Ivan Brawley <brawley@internode.com.au> added better
                    Australian channel frequencies.
                    
1.67    23 May 1999 Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org>
                    Added rgb_vbi_prog() to capture VBI data and video at the
                    same time. To capture VBI data, /dev/vbi must be opened
                    before starting video capture.

1.68    25 May 1999 Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org>
                    Due to differences in PCI bus implementations from various
                    motherboard chipset manufactuers, the Bt878/Bt879 has 3
                    PCI bus compatibility modes. These are
                      NORMAL PCI 2.1  for proper PCI 2.1 compatible chipsets.
                      INTEL 430 FX    for the Intel 430 FX chipset.
                      SIS VIA CHIPSET for certain SiS and VIA chipsets.
                    Older Intel and non-Intel chipsets may also benefit from
                    either 430_FX or SIS/VIA mode.
                    
                    NORMAL PCI mode is enabled by default.
                    For INTEL 430 FX mode, add this to your kenel config:
                           options "BKTR_430_FX_MODE"
                    For SiS / VIA mode, add this to your kernel config:
                           options "BKTR_SIS_VIA_MODE"
                    
                    Using quotes in these options is not needed in FreeBSD 4.x.

                    Note. Newer VIA chipsets should be fully PCI 2.1 compatible
                    and should work fine in the Default mode.

                    Also rename 849 to 849A, the correct name for the chip.

                  Daniel Dagneaux <dagneaux@lure.u-psud.fr>

2.08   6 Mar 2000 Reinstate rgb_vbi_prog as the default RISC program for
                  PAL video. This does not want to work for NTSC, which will
                  continue to use the rgb_prog RISC program.
                  Add support for cable channels above channel 100.
                  Submitted by Scott Presnell <srp@zgi.com>
                  New MSP3410/3415 setup code submitted by
                  Frank Nobis<fn@radio-do.de>. This is experimental and is
                  enabled by setting the sysctl, hw.bt848.slow_msp_audio to 1
                  before starting FXTV (or before opening /dev/bktrN)

2.09  20 Mar 2000 Thomas Klausner <wiz@danbala.ifoer.tuwien.ac.at> submitted
                  patches to include the NetBSD and OpenBSD support from driver
                  1.74 into the new 2.xx driver. NetBSD is tested. OpenBSD is
                  untested.
                  Also fixed coding error in bktr_audio.c spotted by Thomas.
                  Change xxx_ioctl functions to use ioctl_cmd_t for the cmd
                  parameter. Found by looking at OpenBSDs change logs.
                  Delete PROT_EXEC from OpenBSD (as per OpenBSD cvs logs).

2.10   4 Apr 2000 Convert to using bus_space() to access the Bt848/878 registers
                  rather than using a memory mapped structure. This makes the
                  driver portable to other architectures, like Alpha and PPC.
                  This was done by Thomas Klausner <wiz@netbsd.org> and
                  myself Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org>

2.11  15 Apr 2000 Made changes so the driver compiles on FreeBSD/Alpha.
                  Stop printing MSP autodetect. Requested by
                  Chris D. Faulhaber <jedgar@fxp.org>

2.12  16 Apr 2000 Set adelay as an 8 bit value, noticed by
                  Thomas Klausner <wiz@netbsd.org>
                  Fix typo in the new interrupt code.

2.12  20 May 2000 Merge in NetBSD changes from Thomas Klausner <wiz@netbsd.org>
                  following the import of driver 2.12 into NetBSD

2.13  26 Jun 2000 Merge in more changes from Thomas Klausner <wiz@netbsd.org>
                  syncing this driver with the NetBSD source at 25th June.

2.14  28 Jun 2000 Add new Hauppauge Tuner Types, supplied by Hauppauge and
                  required for Josef Karthauser <joe@pavilion.net>
                  Change the structure of some of the #include files and
                  merge in more NetBSD changes.

2.15  10 Sep 2000 Add support for bktr_mem, a module to hold onto the bktr
                  drives's contiguous memory buffers even when it is unloaded
                  and reloaded.
                  Simplify the use of the optional SMBUS i2c code by using a new
                  #define called BKTR_USE_FREEBSD_SMBUS.
                  Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@freebsd.org> changed the DEVFS code.
                  Peter Wemm <peter@freebsd.org> fixed an SMBUS warning.
                  Alexander Langer <alex@cichlids.com> fixed some FreeBSD newbus
                  resource allocation problems (FreeBSD PR kern/18744).

2.16  19 Sep 2000 Merge in NetBSD changes from Thomas Klausner <wiz@netbsd.org>

2.17  19 Oct 2000 Alexander Langer <alex@big.endian.de> and
                  Daniel O'Connor <doconnor@gsoft.com.au>
                  both submitted fixes to devfs code.
                  Fix PHK's commit so we only include machine/clock.h in
                  FreeBSD 2.x, 3.x and 4.x systems

2.18  30 Oct 2000 Roger Hardiman - Add new ioctls to allow userland programs
                  fuller access to the I2C bus, BT848_MSP_READ BT848_MSP_WRITE
                  and BT848_MSP_RESET.
                  Add tuner type 0x2a. Remove 0x2c which was incorrect.
                  Christian Gusenbauer <Christian.Gusenbauer@netway.at> added
                  support for audio on Hauppauge cards without the audio mux.
                  The MSP is used for audio selection. (the 44xxx models)
