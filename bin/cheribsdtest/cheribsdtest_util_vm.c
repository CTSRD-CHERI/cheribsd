/*
 * Find a region of address space unoccupied by any memory mappings.
 *
 * Caveats:
 * - This is not concurency safe and the found region could be disrupted
 *   by any non-MAP_FIXED mmap() call.  This includes anything that
 *   allocates heap memory.
 * - The region between PAGE_SIZE and the first mapping is not currently
 *   searched.
 * - The top of the address space will be searched due to the shared
 *   page at the topmost address.
 * - If an alignment of 0 is pased, the address of a region representable as a
 *   capability will be returned.  It a non-zero alignment is passed it
 *   will be honored even if that results in an address that is
 *   under-aligned relative to a representable capability.
