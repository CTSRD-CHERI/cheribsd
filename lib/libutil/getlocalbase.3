.Dt GETLOCALBASE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getlocalbase
.Nd "return the path to the local software directory"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libutil.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn getlocalbase "char *path" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getlocalbase
function returns the path to the local software base directory.
Normally this is the
.Pa /usr/local
directory.
First the
.Ev LOCALBASE
environment variable is checked.
If that doesn't exist then the
.Va user.localbase
sysctl is checked.
If that also doesn't exist then the value of the
.Dv _PATH_LOCALBASE
compile-time variable is used.
If that is undefined then the default of
.Pa /usr/local
is used.
.Pp
The
.Fa path
argument points to a caller-supplied buffer to hold the resulting pathname.
The
.Fa len
argument is the length of the caller-supplied buffer.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Calls to
.Fn getlocalpath
will perform a setugid check on the running binary before checking the
environment.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the request completes without error, the size of the string copied into the
buffer, including the terminating NUL, is returned.
If an error occurred or the buffer was too small to hold the string,
.Fn getlocalbase
returns -1 and sets
.Em errno
to indicate the error condition.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Fn getlocalbase
library function retrieves the
.Ev LOCALBASE
environment variable.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn getlocalbase
function will fail and set
.Va errno
for the following conditions:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
One of the passed in parameters is NULL or zero.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
There isn't enough space in the passed in buffer to hold the pathname string.
