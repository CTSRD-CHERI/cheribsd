#
# $FreeBSD$
#
# The Broadcom Sentry5 series of processors and boards is very commonly
# used in COTS hardware including the Netgear WGT634U.
#
# Some tweaks are needed for use with this platform:
#
# * CFE firmware's ELF loader expects an ELF kernel which is linked so as
#   not to contain offsets in PT_LOAD which point behind the actual offset
#   of that PT header. FreeBSD normally links the first PT_LOAD header to
#   begin at offset 0.
#
# * Broadcom's support package for the internal bus, the Sonics
#   SiliconBackplane, needs to be integrated to detect and probe hardware
#   correctly.
#
# * The clock needs to be calibrated correctly, so that DELAY() may work.
#   One problem with this is that the low-level printf() routine calls DELAY(),
#   which currently causes divide-by-zero trap
#
# * The Broadcom CPUs have no FPU. Attempting to detect one by reading CP1's
#   status register causes an unhandled boot-time exception. An FPU emulator
#   will be necessary to support multi-user boot.
