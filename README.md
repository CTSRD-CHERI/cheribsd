# CheriBSD

CheriBSD extends FreeBSD to implement memory protection and
software compartmentalization features supported by the CHERI ISA.
CheriBSD includes support for CHERI extensions to the MIPS and RISC-V
architectures.
To build and run CheriBSD we recommend using the
[cheribuild](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild) script.

For information on our branching model, updates, and flag days, please
read [CHERI-UPDATING.md](CHERI-UPDATING.md).

FreeBSD Source:
---------------
This is the top level of the FreeBSD source directory.

FreeBSD is an operating system used to power modern servers, desktops, and embedded platforms.
A large community has continually developed it for more than thirty years.
Its advanced networking, security, and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices.

The Makefile in this directory supports a number of targets for building components (or all) of the FreeBSD source tree.
See build(7), config(8), [FreeBSD handbook on building userland](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/cutting-edge/#makeworld), and [Handbook for kernels](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/kernelconfig/) for more information, including setting make(1) variables.
