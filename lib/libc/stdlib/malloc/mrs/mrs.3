.Sh NAME
.Nm MRS
.Nd Malloc Revocation Shim
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft void *
.Fn malloc "size_t size"
.Ft void *
.Fn calloc "size_t number, size_t size"
.Ft int
.Fn posix_memalign "void **ptr, size_t alignment, size_t size"
.Ft void *
.Fn aligned_alloc "size_t alignment, size_t size"
.Ft void *
.Fn realloc "void *ptr, size_t size"
.Ft void
.Fn free "void *ptr"
.Ft void
.Fn malloc_revoke "void"
.In malloc_np.h
.Ft bool
.Fn malloc_is_revoking "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Malloc Revocation Shim (MRS) extends a CHERI-aware malloc implemention
with revocation support, providing heap temporal safety.
.Nm
wraps the underlying allocator and manages quarantine queues which are revoked
by
.Xr cheri_revoke 2 .
.Pp
.Nm
implements all standard malloc interfaces.
For detailed documentation of those interfaces see
.Xr jemalloc 3 .
It also provides partial implementations of the non-standard
.Xr jemalloc 3
interfaces
.Fn mallocx ,
.Fn rallocx ,
.Fn dallocx ,
and
.Fn sdallocx .
These differ from the underlying implementations in that they always zero
the returned allocation, ignoring passed flags.
The undocumented
.Xr jemalloc 3
3.0 interfaces are not implemented by
.Nm
because no CheriABI program should have ever used them.
.Pp
The
.Fn malloc_revoke
function triggers a full revocation pass, returning when the pass is
complete.
This results in the revocation of all pointers staged for quarantine by
.Fn free
or
.Fn realloc .
.Sh ENABLING REVOCATION
Because heap temporal safety is an experimental feature with performance
impacts that are not fully characterized,
.Nm
provides a number of policy mechanisms to control
.Nm
revocation.
When a program using
.Nm
starts up, an array of parameters are evaluated to determine if free'd
objects should be quarantined and revoked or if the underlying
implementations should be exposed directly.
If the
.Dv ELF_BSDF_CHERI_REVOKE
flag of the
.Dv AT_BSDFLAGS
ELF auxiliary argument variable is set then the program will revoke.
.Pp
.\" XXX: this is not tied to mrs and probably belongs somewhere else
The kernel considers the following factors in order of decreasing precedence
when setting
.Dv AT_BSDFLAGS
flags:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The presence of
.Dv P2_CHERI_REVOKE_ENABLE
or
.Dv P2_CHERI_REVOKE_DISABLE
in the process flags as controlled by
the
.Xr procctl 2
.Dv PROC_CHERI_REVOKE_CTL
command which is administratively set by
.Xr proccontrol 1 .
If either is set then
.Dv ELF_BSDF_CHERI_REVOKE
is set if
.Dv P2_CHERI_REVOKE_DISABLE
is not present and further factors are not considered.
.It
The presence of
.Dv NT_FREEBSD_FCTL_CHERI_REVOKE_DISABLE
or
.Dv NT_FREEBSD_FCTL_CHERI_REVOKE_ENABLE
in the FreeBSD feature control ELF note as set by
.Xr elfctl 1 .
If either is set then
.Dv ELF_BSDF_CHERI_REVOKE
is set if
.Dv NT_FREEBSD_FCTL_CHERI_REVOKE_DISABLE
is not present and further factors are not considered.
.It
The value of the
.Dv security.cheri.runtime_revocation_default
sysctl value.
If this is non-zero then
.Dv ELF_BSDF_CHERI_REVOKE
is set.
.El
.Pp
A program can determine at runtime if
.Nm
revocation is enabled by checking the return value of
.Fn malloc_is_revoking .
.Sh TRACING
.Nm
supports
.Xr utrace 2
event logging which can be enabled by setting the
.Ev _MRS_UTRACE
environmental variable, collected by
.Xr ktrace 1
and viewed by
.Xr kdump 1 .
This produces output like:
.Pp
.Dl $ kdump -H -t u
.Dl  21593 101243 git      USER  0x45e00000 = malloc(50708)
.Dl  21593 101243 git      USER  0x45e00000 = mrs_malloc(50708)
.Dl  21593 101243 git      USER  mrs_free(0x45e00000)
.Dl  21593 101243 git      USER  quarantine_insert(0x45e00000, 57344)
.Dl  21593 101242 git      USER  quarantine_flush()
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Nm
requires that allocators be extended to provide a
.Ft void *
.Fn malloc_underlying_allocation "void *"
interface which takes a capability passed to
.Fn free
or
.Fn realloc
and returns a capability to the underlying allocator bearing the
.Dt CHERI_PERM_SW_VMEM
permission.
This capability will not be revoked and thus can be stored in the quarantine
structure.
This interface must not be exported outside the implementation.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To alter a binary to disable use of revocation, use:
.Pp
.Dl elfctl -e +nocherirevoke <program>
.Pp
To override the system default and binary settings run the program as follows:
.Pp
.Dl proccontrol -m cherirevoke -s enable <program>

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
currently has a single quarantine queue protected by a mutex.
For multi-threaded applications where concurent
.Xr malloc 3
performance is important, this will be a significant bottleneck.
