/*
 * __mcount is like [.]mcount except that doesn't require its caller to set
 * up a frame pointer.  It must be called before pushing anything onto the
 * stack.  gcc should eventually generate code to call __mcount in most
 * cases.  This would make -pg in combination with -fomit-frame-pointer
 * useful.  gcc has a configuration variable PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE to
 * allow profiling before setting up the frame pointer, but this is
 * inadequate for good handling of special cases, e.g., -fpic works best
 * with profiling after the prologue.
 *
 * [.]mexitcount is a new function to support non-statistical profiling if an
 * accurate clock is available.  For C sources, calls to it are generated
 * by the FreeBSD extension `-mprofiler-epilogue' to gcc.  It is best to
 * call [.]mexitcount at the end of a function like the MEXITCOUNT macro does,
 * but gcc currently generates calls to it at the start of the epilogue to
 * avoid problems with -fpic.
 *
 * [.]mcount and __mcount may clobber the call-used registers and %ef.
 * [.]mexitcount may clobber %ecx and %ef.
 *
 * Cross-jumping makes non-statistical profiling timing more complicated.
 * It is handled in many cases by calling [.]mexitcount before jumping.  It
 * is handled for conditional jumps using CROSSJUMP() and CROSSJUMP_LABEL().
 * It is handled for some fault-handling jumps by not sharing the exit
 * routine.
 *
 * ALTENTRY() must be before a corresponding ENTRY() so that it can jump to
 * the main entry point.  Note that alt entries are counted twice.  They
 * have to be counted as ordinary entries for gprof to get the call times
 * right for the ordinary entries.
 *
 * High local labels are used in macros to avoid clashes with local labels
 * in functions.
 *
 * Ordinary `ret' is used instead of a macro `RET' because there are a lot
 * of `ret's.  0xc3 is the opcode for `ret' (`#define ret ... ret' can't
 * be used because this file is sometimes preprocessed in traditional mode).
 * `ret' clobbers eflags but this doesn't matter.
