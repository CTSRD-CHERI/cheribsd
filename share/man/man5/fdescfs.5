.Dt FDESCFS 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fdescfs
.Nd file-descriptor file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
fdescfs	/dev/fd	fdescfs rw 0 0
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file-descriptor file system, or
.Nm ,
provides access to the per-process file descriptor
namespace in the global file system namespace.
The conventional mount point is
.Pa /dev/fd .
.Pp
The file system's contents
appear as a list of numbered files
which correspond to the open files of the process reading the
directory.
The files
.Pa /dev/fd/0
through
.Pa /dev/fd/#
refer to file descriptors which can be accessed through the file
system.
If the file descriptor is open and the mode the file is being opened
with is a subset of the mode of the existing descriptor, the call:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fd = open("/dev/fd/0", mode);
.Ed
.Pp
and the call:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fd = fcntl(0, F_DUPFD, 0);
.Ed
.Pp
are equivalent.
.Pp
Flags to the
.Xr open 2
call other than
.Dv O_RDONLY ,
.Dv O_WRONLY
and
.Dv O_RDWR
are ignored.
.Pp
.Em "Note:"
.Pa /dev/fd/0 ,
.Pa /dev/fd/1
and
.Pa /dev/fd/2
files are created by default when devfs alone is mounted.
.Nm
creates entries for all file descriptors opened by the process.
.Pp
For
.Xr linux 4
ABI compatibility mount
.Nm
volume with
.Cm linrdlnk
option.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/stderr -compact
.It Pa /dev/fd/#
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To mount a
.Nm
volume located on
.Pa /dev/fd :
.Pp
.Dl "mount -t fdescfs null /dev/fd"
.Pp
For
.Xr linux 4
ABI compatibility:
.Pp
.Dl "mount -t fdescfs -o linrdlnk null /compat/linux/dev/fd"
