/*
 * The sandbox statistic mechanism tracks active sandbox classes, methods, and
 * objects, in order to provide useful measurement and diagnostic output for
 * procstat(1) and other tools.  The in-memory representation is designed to
 * make external access simple, rather than offer more mature internal
 * representations (for now).  It takes a particular concern with ABI and safe
 * external concurrent access.  All data structures are designed to be
 * 32/64-bit oblivious -- where pointers must be embedded, they should always
 * be stored in 64-bit fields (although they are largely avoided).
 *
 * External access currently occurs via sysctls offered by the kernel using
 * the ps_string mechanism (a data structure at the top of the main process
 * stack with a set of pointers and lengths into user data that the kernel
 * provides access to).  This is similar to the mechanisms used to allow
 * command-line string and ELF auxiliary data export, and in some ways
 * comparable to GDB's use of rtld-internal state in order to provide useful
 * shared-object debugging information.
 *
 * Three memory regions are maintained, one each for classes, methods, and
 * objects.  Each is an array of structures, one per instance of each.  A
 * unique numeric identifier may be set to '0' to indicate an array slot is
 * unused, or to a value provided by the statistics framework.  String names
 * (for classes, methods) or numeric names (for objects) are also provided
 * (but could have collisions, hence unique IDs).  libprocstat(3) provides a
 * simple API to extract the information for display by procstat(1) and other
 * tools.
 *
 * Consumer code -- e.g., libcheri's sandbox mechanism -- must register and
 * deregister classes, methods, and objects using APIs for them to become
 * visible (and disappear).  Statistics are also maintained by callers via
 * APIs.
 *
 * It is easy to imagine numerous enhancements to binary compatibility,
 * flexibility, etc.

/*
 * Synchronisation in this file is slightly obscure.  From an in-process
 * perspective, it is all about this one lock -- and it is the responsibility
 * of the consumer to not deregister sandboxes or methods prematurely, or more
 * than once.
 *
 * However, we are producing data structures that will be read from outside
 * the process, not just from within.  Sandbox and method IDs of 0 mean
 * unused, so ensure any data structure in an inconsistently allocated or
 * freed state always has an ID of zero, and do this with acquire/release
 * semantics to ensure the 0 is set last during registration, and first during
 * deregistration.  This should minimise confusion in consuming applications,
 * which may see inconsistency (due to racing with libcheri) but at least
 * won't see pre-registration/post-deregistration values.
 *
 * XXXRW: Statistics are updated without the lock -- currently with no
 * synchronisation, but atomic operations could easily be used.  See the
 * macros in libprocstat/sandbox_stat.h.
 *
 * XXXRW: Should we do the thing where we put a generation counter at both the
 * beginning and end of the structure so that a consumer can detect an
 * inconsistent snapshot...?
