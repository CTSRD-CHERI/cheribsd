.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for the Altera Triple-Speed Ethernet
MegaCore.
.Sh HARDWARE
The current version of the
.Nm
driver supports the Ethernet MegaCore as described in version 11.1 of
Altera's documentation when the device is configured with internal FIFOs.
.Sh MAC SELECTION
The default MAC address for each
.Nm
interface is derived from a value stored in
.Xr cfi 4
flash.
The value is managed by the
.Xr atsectl 8
utility.
.Pp
Only a single MAC address may be stored in flash.
If the address begins with the Altera prefix 00:07:ed and ends in 00 then
up to 16 addresses will be derived from it by adding the unit number of
the interface to the stored address.
For other prefixes, the address will be assigned to atse0 and random
addresses will be used for other interfaces.
If the stored address is invalid, for example all zero's, multicast, or the
default address shipped on all DE4 boards (00:07:ed:ff:ed:15) then a random
address is generated when the device is attached.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 10.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
device driver and this manual page were
developed by SRI International and the University of Cambridge Computer
Laboratory under DARPA/AFRL contract
.Pq FA8750-10-C-0237
.Pq Do CTSRD Dc ,
as part of the DARPA CRASH research programme.
This device driver was written by
.An Bjoern A. Zeeb .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver only supports a single configuration of the MegaCore as installed
on the Terasic Technologies Altera DE4 Development and Education Board.
.Pp
Only gigabit Ethernet speeds are currently supported.
