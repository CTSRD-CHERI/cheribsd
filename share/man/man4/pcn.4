.Sh NAME
.Nm pcn
.Nd "AMD PCnet/PCI Fast Ethernet device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device pcn"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_pcn_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
The
.Nm
driver is not present in
.Fx 13.0
and later.
See https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for more
information.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
controllers based on the AMD PCnet/FAST, PCnet/FAST+, PCnet/FAST III,
PCnet/PRO and PCnet/Home Ethernet controller chips.
Supported NIC's include the Allied Telesyn AT-2700 family.
.Pp
The PCnet/PCI chips include a 100Mbps Ethernet MAC and support
both a serial and MII-compliant transceiver interface.
They use a bus master DMA and a scatter/gather descriptor scheme.
The AMD chips provide a mechanism for zero-copy receive,
providing good performance in server environments.
Receive address filtering is provided using a single perfect filter entry
for the station address and a 64-bit multicast hash table.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width 10baseTXUTP
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Sq full-duplex
or
.Sq half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Sq full-duplex
or
.Sq half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "pcn%d: couldn't map ports/memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "pcn%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "pcn%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (e.g.\& a cable fault).
.It "pcn%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "pcn%d: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.
.It "pcn%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to adapters which support power
management.
Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it.
The controller loses all of
its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the BIOS does not set
it back to full power mode in time, it will not be able to configure it
correctly.
The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition.
If
you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, you will have to perform a
warm boot to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system.
If you power down your system prior to booting
.Fx ,
the card should be configured correctly.
