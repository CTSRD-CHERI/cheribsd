.Sh NAME
.Nm ufm
.Nd USB driver for Cypress Semiconductor FM Radio
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ufm"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ufm_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the D-Link/GEMTEK FM tuner.
The USB interface chip is the common Cypress 63001, and the tuner is a
Philips TEA5757 radio chip that uses a serial interface to set the
tuner parameters.
This design is used in the D-Link DSB-R100 USB Radio.
.Pp
The
.Nm
device must be configured in the kernel, along with
.Xr usb 4
and one of the
.Xr uhci 4
or
.Xr ohci 4
controllers.
.Pp
Subsequently, the
.Pa /dev/ufm0
device can be used by userland applications.
