.Sh NAME
.Nm ce
.Nd "driver for synchronous Cronyx Tau-PCI/32 WAN adapters"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ce"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_ce_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver creates a
.Xr netgraph 4
node for each device found.
The node is usually paired with
.Xr ng_async 4 ,
.Xr ng_cisco 4 ,
.Xr ng_frame_relay 4
or with
.Xr ng_ppp 4
under control of net/mpd5 port.
.Pp
Refer to
.Xr sconfig 8
for information about the
.Nm
adapter configuration.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following models of Tau-PCI/32 WAN adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -compact
.It Cronyx Tau-PCI/32
two fractional/unframed E1 interfaces,
with 32 HDLC channels shared between them with total adapter throughput
2048 kbps.
.It Cronyx Tau-PCI/32-Lite
single fractional/unframed E1 interface,
with 32 HDLC channels.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cp 4 ,
.Xr netgraph 4 ,
.Xr sconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was added in
.Fx 6.2 ,
.Fx 5.5
and
.Fx 4.11 .
