.Sh NAME
.Nm ce
.Nd "driver for synchronous Cronyx Tau-PCI/32 WAN adapters"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ce"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_ce_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
Additional options:
.Cd "device sppp"
.Cd "options NETGRAPH"
.Cd "options NETGRAPH_CRONYX"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver needs either
.Xr sppp 4
or
.Xr netgraph 4 .
Which one to use is determined by the
.Dv NETGRAPH_CRONYX
option.
If this option is present in your kernel configuration file, the
.Nm
driver will be compiled with
.Xr netgraph 4
support.
Otherwise, it will be compiled with
.Xr sppp 4
support.
.Pp
Refer to
.Xr sconfig 8
for information about the
.Nm
adapter configuration.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following models of Tau-PCI/32 WAN adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -compact
.It Cronyx Tau-PCI/32
two fractional/unframed E1 interfaces,
with 32 HDLC channels shared between them with total adapter throughput
2048 kbps.
.It Cronyx Tau-PCI/32-Lite
single fractional/unframed E1 interface,
with 32 HDLC channels.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was added in
.Fx 6.2 ,
.Fx 5.5
and
.Fx 4.11 .
The
.Nm
driver for previous versions of
.Fx
is available from
