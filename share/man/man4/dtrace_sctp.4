.Sh DESCRIPTION
The DTrace
.Nm sctp
provider allows users to trace events in the
.Xr sctp 4
protocol implementation.
This provider is similar to the
.Xr dtrace_ip 4
and
.Xr dtrace_udp 4
providers,
but additionally contains probes corresponding to protocol events at a level
higher than packet reception and transmission.
.Pp
The
.Fn sctp:cwnd::
probes track changes in the congestion window on a netp.
The
.Fn sctp:rwnd::
probes track changes in the receiver window for an assoc.
The
.Fn sctp:flightsize:net:val
probe tracks changes in the flight size on a net or assoc and the
.Fn sctp:flightsize:assoc:val
probe provides the total flight version.
.Pp
The arguments of all
.Nm sctp
probes except for
.Fn sctp:cwnd::rtt*
and
.Fn sctp::assoc:val
are the Vtag for this end,
the port number of the local side,
the pointer to
.Dv struct sctp_nets *changing ,
the old value of the cwnd,
and the new value of the cwnd.
.Pp
The arguments of
.Fn sctp:::val
are similar to the above except the fourth argument is the up/down amount.
.Pp
The
.Fn sctp:cwnd::rtt*
probe arguments are a bitmap of
.Dv Vtag << 32 | localport << 16 | remoteport ,
a bitmap of
.Dv obw | nbw ,
a bitmap of
.Dv bwrtt | newrtt ,
.Dv flight ,
and a bitmap of
.Dv (cwnd << 32) | point << 16 | retval(0/1) .
.Pp
The
.Fn sctp:cwnd::init
probe fires when a remotely-initiated active SCTP open succeeds.
At this point the new connection is in the ESTABLISHED state, and the probe
arguments expose the headers associated with the final ACK of the four-way
handshake.
