.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sndstat
.Nd "nvlist-based PCM audio device enumeration interface"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile the driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in the
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sound"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The ioctl interface provided by
.Pa /dev/sndstat
device allows callers to enumeration PCM audio devices available for use.
.Sh IOCTLS
For all ioctls requiring data exchange between the subsystem and callers,
the following structures are used to describe a serialized nvlist:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct sndstat_nvlbuf_arg {
	size_t nbytes;
	void *buf;
};
.Ed
.Pp
Here is an example of an nvlist, with explanations of the common fields:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dsps (NVLIST ARRAY): 1
    from_user (BOOL): FALSE
    nameunit (STRING): [pcm0]
    devnode (STRING): [dsp0]
    desc (STRING): [Generic (0x8086) (Analog Line-out)]
    pchan (NUMBER): 1 (1) (0x1)
    rchan (NUMBER): 0 (0) (0x0)
    pminrate (NUMBER): 48000 (48000) (0xbb80)
    pmaxrate (NUMBER): 48000 (48000) (0xbb80)
    pfmts (NUMBER): 2097168 (2097168) (0x200010)
    provider_info (NVLIST):
        unit (NUMBER): 0 (0) (0x0)
        bitperfect (BOOL): FALSE
        pvchan (NUMBER): 1 (1) (0x1)
        rvchan (NUMBER): 0 (0) (0x0)
    provider (STRING): [sound(4)]
    ,
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv provider_info"
.It Dv from_user
Whether the PCM audio device node is created by in-kernel audio subsystem or
userspace providers.
.It Dv nameunit
The device identification in the form of subsystem plus a unit number.
.It Dv devnode
The PCM audio device node relative path in devfs.
.It Dv desc
The descripton of the PCM audio device.
.It Dv pchan
The number of playback channels supported by hardware.
This can be 0 if this PCM audio device does not support playback at all.
.It Dv rchan
The number of recording channels supported by hardware.
This can be 0 if this PCM audio device does not support recording at all.
.It Dv pminrate
The minimum supported playback direction sampling rate.
Only exists if pchan is greater than 0.
.It Dv pmaxrate
The maximum supported playback direction sampling rate.
Only exists if pchan is greater than 0.
.It Dv pfmts
The supported playback direction sample format.
Only exists if pchan is greater than 0.
.It Dv rminrate
The minimum supported recording direction sampling rate.
Only exists if rchan is greater than 0.
.It Dv rmaxrate
The maximum supported recording direction sampling rate.
Only exists if rchan is greater than 0.
.It Dv rfmts
The supported playback recording sample format.
Only exists if rchan is greater than 0.
.It Dv provider_info
Provider-specific fields.
This field may not exist if the PCM audio device is not provided by in-kernel
interface.
This field will not exist if the provider field is an empty string.
.It Dv provider
A string specifying the provider of the PCm audio device.
.El
.Pp
The following ioctls are providede for use:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv SNDSTAT_FLUSH_USER_DEVS"
.It Dv SNDSTAT_REFRESH_DEVS
Drop any previously fetched PCM audio devices list snapshots.
This ioctl takes no arguments.
.It Dv SNDSTAT_GET_DEVS
Generate and/or return PCM audio devices list snapshots to callers.
This ioctl takes a pointer to
.Fa struct sndstat_nvlbuf_arg
as the first and the only argument.
Callers need to provide a sufficiently large buffer to hold a serialized
nvlist.
If there is no existing PCM audio device list snapshot available in the
internal structure of the opened sndstat.
.Fa fd ,
a new PCM audio device list snapshot will be automatically generated.
Callers have to set
.Fa nbytes
to either 0 or the size of buffer provided.
In case
.Fa nbytes
is 0, the buffer size required to hold a serialized nvlist
stream of current snapshot will be returned in
.Fa nbytes ,
and
.Fa buf
will be ignored.
Otherwise, if the buffer is not sufficiently large,
the ioctl returns success, and
.Fa nbytes
will be set to 0.
If the buffer provided is sufficiently large,
.Fa nbytes
will be set to the size of the serialized nvlist written to the provided buffer.
Once a PCM audio device list snapshot is returned to user-space successfully,
the snapshot stored in the subsystem's internal structure of the given
.Fa fd
will be freed.
.It Dv SNDSTAT_ADD_USER_DEVS
Add a list of PCM audio devices provided by callers to
.Pa /dev/sndstat
device.
This ioctl takes a pointer to
.Fa struct sndstat_nvlbuf_arg
as the first and the only argument.
Callers have to provide a buffer holding a serialized nvlist.
.Fa nbytes
should be set to the length in bytes of the serialized nvlist.
.Fa buf
should be pointed to a buffer storing the serialized nvlist.
Userspace-backed PCM audio device nodes should be listed inside the serialized
nvlist.
.It Dv SNDSTAT_FLUSH_USER_DEVS
Flush any PCM audio devices previously added by callers.
This ioctl takes no arguments.
