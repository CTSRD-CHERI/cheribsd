Tagged queueing is supported on 'W' series adapters, 'C' series adapters
with firmware of rev 4.42 and higher, and 'S' series adapters with firmware
of rev 3.35 and higher.
.Pp
Boards with certain firmware revisions may lock up under heavy load to
certain devices, especially if tagged queueing is used.
Should you encounter
a problem with your adapter, contact Mylex technical support and ensure you
have the latest firmware for your controller.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in the
.Bx 386
patch kit.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
.An Julian Elischer
wrote a driver for the Multimaster cards that appeared in the
.Bx 386
patch kit.
The driver was rewritten by
.An Justin T. Gibbs
to take advantage of new board features and work with the CAM SCSI framework in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Pp
Special thanks to
.An Leonard N. Zubkoff
for writing such a complete and well documented Mylex/BusLogic MultiMaster
driver for Linux.
Support in this driver for the wide range of MultiMaster
controllers and firmware revisions, with their otherwise undocumented quirks,
would not have been possible without his efforts.
