.Sh NAME
.Nm lorder
.Nd list dependencies for object files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses
.Xr nm 1
to determine interdependencies in the list of object files
and library archives
specified on the command line.
The
.Nm
utility outputs a list of file names where the first file contains a symbol
which is defined by the second file.
.Pp
The output is normally used with
.Xr tsort 1
when a library is created to determine the optimum ordering of the
object modules so that all references may be resolved in a single
pass of the loader.
.Pp
When linking static binaries,
.Nm
and
.Xr tsort 1
can be used to properly order library archives automatically.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev NM
Path to the
.Xr nm 1
binary, defaults to
.Dq Li nm .
.It Ev NMFLAGS
Flags to pass to
.Xr nm 1 .

cc -o foo ${OBJS} `lorder ${STATIC_LIBS} | tsort`
