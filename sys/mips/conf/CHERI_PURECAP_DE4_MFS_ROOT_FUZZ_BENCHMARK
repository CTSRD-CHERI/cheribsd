#
# CHERI -- Kernel for the SRI/Cambridge "CHERI" (Capability Hardware Enhanced
# RISC Instructions) FPGA soft core, as configured in its Terasic DE-4
# reference configuration - 128bit version.
#
# This configuration is the same as the pure capability benchmark kernel with MFS root,
# with the addition of kernel coverage.
# Note: This MUST not be used for benchmarking because of the high probe effect of kcov,
# this is meant to extract coverage from a kernel as close as possible to the benchmark.
