.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cryptography and compression acceleration of the
Intel (R) QuickAssist Technology (QAT) devices.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver is intended for platforms that contain:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Intel (R) C62x Chipset
.It
Intel (R) Atom C3000 processor product family
.It
Intel (R) QuickAssist Adapter 8960/Intel (R) QuickAssist Adapter 8970
(formerly known as "Lewis Hill")
.It
Intel (R) Communications Chipset 8925 to 8955 Series
.It
Intel (R) Atom P5300 processor product family
.It

.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports cryptography and compression acceleration.
A complete API for offloading these operations is exposed in the kernel and may
be used by any other entity directly.

In addition to exposing complete kernel API for offloading cryptography and
compression operations, the
.Nm
driver also integrates with
.Xr crypto 4 ,
allowing offloading supported cryptography operations to Intel (R) QuickAssist
Technology (QAT) devices.
For details of usage and supported operations and algorithms refer to the
documentation mentioned above and

section.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
driver replaced previous implementation introduced in
.Fx 13.0 .
Current version, in addition to
.Xr crypto 4
integration, supports also data compression and exposes a complete API for
offloading data compression and cryptography operations.
