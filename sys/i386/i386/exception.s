/*
 * Trap and fault vector routines.
 *
 * Most traps are 'trap gates', SDT_SYS386TGT.  A trap gate pushes state on
 * the stack that mostly looks like an interrupt, but does not disable
 * interrupts.  A few of the traps we are use are interrupt gates,
 * SDT_SYS386IGT, which are nearly the same thing except interrupts are
 * disabled on entry.
 *
 * The cpu will push a certain amount of state onto the kernel stack for
 * the current process.  The amount of state depends on the type of trap
 * and whether the trap crossed rings or not.  See i386/include/frame.h.
 * At the very least the current EFLAGS (status register, which includes
 * the interrupt disable state prior to the trap), the code segment register,
 * and the return instruction pointer are pushed by the cpu.  The cpu
 * will also push an 'error' code for certain traps.  We push a dummy
 * error code for those traps where the cpu doesn't in order to maintain
 * a consistent frame.  We also push a contrived 'trap number'.
 *
 * The cpu does not push the general registers, we must do that, and we
 * must restore them prior to calling 'iret'.  The cpu adjusts the %cs and
 * %ss segment registers, but does not mess with %ds, %es, or %fs.  Thus we
 * must load them with appropriate values for supervisor mode operation.
