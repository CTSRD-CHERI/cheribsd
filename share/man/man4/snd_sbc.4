.Nm snd_sb8
.Nd Creative Sound Blaster ISA and compatible bridge device driver
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
This driver is scheduled for removal prior to the release of
.Fx 14.0 .
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sound"
.Cd "device snd_sbc"
.Cd "device snd_sb16"
.Cd "device snd_sb8"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snd_sbc_load="YES"
snd_sb16_load="YES"
snd_sb8_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
Non-PnP cards require the following lines in
.Xr device.hints 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hint.sbc.0.at="isa"
hint.sbc.0.port="0x220"
hint.sbc.0.irq="5"
hint.sbc.0.drq="1"
hint.sbc.0.flags="0x15"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bridge driver allows the generic audio driver
.Xr sound 4
to attach to Creative Sound Blaster ISA (mostly SB16 or SB8, known as
SoundBlaster Pro) compatible audio cards.
.Pp
The value of flags specifies the secondary DMA channel.
If the secondary
DMA channel is C, set the flags to (C | 0x10).
For a sound card without the
secondary DMA channel, the flags should be set to zero.

The
.Nm
driver supports the following sound cards:
