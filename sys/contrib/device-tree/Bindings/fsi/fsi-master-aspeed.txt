Device-tree bindings for AST2600 FSI master
-------------------------------------------

The AST2600 contains two identical FSI masters. They share a clock and have a
separate interrupt line and output pins.

Required properties:
 - compatible: "aspeed,ast2600-fsi-master"
 - reg: base address and length
 - clocks: phandle and clock number
 - interrupts: platform dependent interrupt description
 - pinctrl-0: phandle to pinctrl node
 - pinctrl-names: pinctrl state

Examples:

    fsi-master {
        compatible = "aspeed,ast2600-fsi-master", "fsi-master";
        reg = <0x1e79b000 0x94>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 100 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_fsi1_default>;
	clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_FSICLK>;
    };
