/*
 * The outermost capability revocation state machine.
 *
 *   We begin with no revocation in progress (CAPREVST_NONE).  Userland can
 *   request that we steal the calling thread to carry out an initial pass,
 *   which will begin the next epoch and visit all cap-dirty pages in the
 *   address space, moving us to CAPREVST_INIT_PASS for the duration and to
 *   CAPREVST_INIT_DONE upon completion, before returning to userland.
 *
 *   We are now in the store-side steady state for this epoch: we need only
 *   look at *recently* capdirty pages, kernel hoarders, and register files
 *   to find should-be-revoked pages.  Userland can request additional
 *   passes, which will be *incremental* passes, visiting only capdirty
 *   pages (and keeping us in CAPREVST_STORE_DONE).
 *
 *   Alternatively, userland can request that we finish this epoch,
 *   transitioning us into CAPREVST_LAST_PASS for the duration.  This pass
 *   visits all recently capdirty pages, kernel hoarders, and thread
 *   register files.  It implies at least some brief window of
 *   thread_single'd life.  When this pass finishes, it again increments
 *   the epoch counter, signaling the end of this epoch.
 *
 *     XXX The thread_single window can be reduced by using the "load-side"
 *     strategy, in which we temporarily remove read access to all
 *     recently-capdirty pages and then un-thread_single.  We would continue
 *     to use the calling thread to sweep pages "in the background", but would
 *     also clean pages when taking vm faults.  The epoch must not end
 *     before all pages have been cleaned!
 *
 *   Userland might cause us to jump directly from CAPREVST_NONE to
 *   CAPREVST_LAST_PASS.  This case is *almost* like the above, except that
 *   we have to consider *all* capdirty pages, not just recently-capdirty.
 *
 * The state and epoch counter are stored in the same per-process word,
 * vm_caprev_st.  There is, at present, at most one thread actively engaged
 * in revocation per process.
