	 * In the (size > 0 && (com & IOC_VOID) != 0) case, the kernel assigns
	 * the value of data to an int and passes a pointer to that int down,
	 * so we want to extract an int here. Otherwise for (size > 0) we have
	 * a normal IN and/or OUT ioctl that takes a pointer to the actual data
	 * whose size is encoded, so we want to extract a pointer here.
	 *
	 * XXX: Not all ioctls adhere to the standard encoding, both in
	 * direction and in size. For example, GIO_KEYMAP is size == 0 with
	 * IOC_VOID as the real size doesn't fit in the parameter length field.
	 * In the size == 0 case, peek at the varargs array to see how much
	 * space is left. We may want an __np_va_space_remaining or the like to
	 * not assume the layout of the varargs array. This relies on varargs
	 * slots always being full capabilities with the integer in the address
	 * portion (or, if varargs bounds are not precise, that capabilities
	 * are little-endian), and always being capability-aligned if the
	 * varargs array capability's length is at least sizeof(void *) (which
	 * is true by virtue of stack-alignment on architectures without
	 * bounded varargs, and trivially true on architectures with bounded
	 * varargs, regardless of whether slots are capability-sized).
	 *
	 * Ideally these would be encoded differently to remove this ambiguity,
	 * perhaps as IOC_VOID with size(void *) like the int case.
