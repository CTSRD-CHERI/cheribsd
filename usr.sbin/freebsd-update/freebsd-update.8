.Sh NAME
.Nm freebsd-update
.Nd fetch and install binary updates to FreeBSD
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b Ar basedir
.Op Fl d Ar workdir
.Op Fl f Ar conffile
.Op Fl F
.Op Fl k Ar KEY
.Op Fl r Ar newrelease
.Op Fl s Ar server
.Op Fl t Ar address
.Op Fl -not-running-from-cron
.Cm command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool is used to fetch, install, and rollback binary
updates to the
.Fx
base system.
Note that updates are only available if they are being built for the
.Fx
release and architecture being used; in particular, the
.Fx
Security Team only builds updates for releases shipped in binary form
by the
.Fx
Release Engineering Team, e.g.,
.Fx
11.2-RELEASE and
.Fx
12.0-RELEASE, but not
.Fx
11.2-STABLE or
.Fx
13.0-CURRENT.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "-r newrelease"
.It Fl b Ar basedir
Operate on a system mounted at
.Ar basedir .
(default:
.Pa / ,
or as given in the configuration file.)
.It Fl d Ar workdir
Store working files in
.Ar workdir .
(default:
.Pa /var/db/freebsd-update/ ,
or as given in the configuration file.)
.It Fl f Ar conffile
Read configuration options from
.Ar conffile .
(default:
.Pa /etc/freebsd-update.conf )
.It Fl F
Force
.Nm Cm fetch
to proceed in the case of an unfinished upgrade.
.It Fl k Ar KEY
Trust an RSA key with SHA256 of
.Ar KEY .
(default: read value from configuration file.)
.It Fl r Ar newrelease
Specify the new release (e.g. 11.2-RELEASE) to which
.Nm
should upgrade (upgrade command only).
.It Fl s Ar server
Fetch files from the specified server or server pool.
(default: read value from configuration file.)
.It Fl t Ar address
Mail output of
.Cm cron
command, if any, to
.Ar address .
(default: root, or as given in the configuration file.)
.It Fl -not-running-from-cron
Force
.Nm Cm fetch
to proceed when there is no controlling tty.
This is for use by automated scripts and orchestration tools.
Please do not run
.Nm Cm fetch
from crontab or similar using this flag, see:
.Nm Cm cron
.It Fl -currently-running Ar release
Do not detect the currently-running release; instead, assume that the
system is running the specified
.Ar release .
This is most likely to be useful when upgrading jails.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
The
.Cm command
can be any one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "rollback"
.It Cm fetch
Based on the currently installed world and the configuration
options set, fetch all available binary updates.
.It Cm cron
Sleep a random amount of time between 1 and 3600 seconds,
then download updates as if the
.Cm fetch
command was used.
If updates are downloaded, an email will be sent
(to root or a different address if specified via the
.Fl t
option or in the configuration file).
As the name suggests, this command is designed for running
from
.Xr cron 8 ;
the random delay serves to minimize the probability that
a large number of machines will simultaneously attempt to
fetch updates.
.It Cm upgrade
Fetch files necessary for upgrading to a new release.
Before using this command, make sure that you read the
announcement and release notes for the new release in
case there are any special steps needed for upgrading.
Note that this command may require up to 500 MB of space in
.Ar workdir
depending on which components of the
.Fx
base system are installed.
.It Cm install
Install the most recently fetched updates or upgrade.
.It Cm rollback
Uninstall the most recently installed updates.
.It Cm IDS
Compare the system against a "known good" index of the
installed release.
.El
.Sh TIPS
.Bl -bullet
.It
If your clock is set to local time, adding the line
.Pp
.Dl 0 3 * * * root /usr/sbin/freebsd-update cron
.Pp
to /etc/crontab will check for updates every night.
If your clock is set to UTC, please pick a random time
other than 3AM, to avoid overly imposing an uneven load
on the server(s) hosting the updates.
.It
In spite of its name,
.Nm
IDS should not be relied upon as an "Intrusion Detection
System", since if the system has been tampered with
it cannot be trusted to operate correctly.
If you intend to use this command for intrusion-detection
purposes, make sure you boot from a secure disk (e.g., a CD).
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/freebsd-update.conf"
.It Pa /etc/freebsd-update.conf
Default location of the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Pa /var/db/freebsd-update/
Default location where
.Nm
stores temporary files and downloaded updates.
