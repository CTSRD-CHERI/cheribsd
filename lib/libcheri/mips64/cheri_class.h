 * CHERI system class CCall landing pad code: catches CCalls inbound from
 * sandboxes seeking system services, and bootstraps C code.  A number of
 * differences from sandboxed code, including how $c0 is handled, and not
 * setting up the C heap.
 *
 * Temporary ABI conventions:
 *    $sp contains a pointer to the top of the stack; capability aligned
 *    $fp contains a pointer to the top of the stack; capability aligned
 *
 *    $a0-$a7 contain user arguments
 *    $v0, $v1 contain user return values
 *
 *    $c0, $pcc contain access to (100% overlapped) sandbox code and data
 *
 *    $c1, $c2 contain the invoked object capability
 *    $c3-$c10 contain user capability arguments
 *
 *    $c26 contains the invoked data capability installed by CCall; unlike
 *      sandboxed versions of this code, this points at actual data rather
 *      than being the value to install in $c0.  $c0 is copied from $pcc.
 *
 * Sandbox heap information is extracted from the sandbox metadata structure.
 * $c26 is assumed to have room for a stack at the top, although its length is
 * currently undefined.
 *
 * For now, assume:
 * (1) The caller has not set up the general-purpose register context, that's
 *     our job.
 * (2) That there is no concurrent sandbox use -- we have a single stack on
 *     the inbound path, which can't be the long-term solution.
