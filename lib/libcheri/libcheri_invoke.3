.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn libcheri_invoke
is a C-language wrapper for the CHERI
.Li CCall
instruction, taking as its arguments code and data capabilities
.Li ($c1 , $c2 ) ,
a set of general-purpose argument registers, and a set of capability argument
registers.
If compiling with a capability-aware compiler, then capability arguments are
explicit and the compiler will arrange for the arguments to be placed in the
appropriate hardware registers.
Without compiler support, explicit assembly instructions must be used to
implement the CHERI ABI.
By convention,
.Li $v0
will contain a method number.
.Pp
Most programmers will prefer to employ the
.Xr libcheri 3
sandbox API rather than use
.Fn libcheri_invoke
directly.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn libcheri_invoke
returns the value returned by the invoked capabilities unless a sandbox fault
occurs, in which case -1 will be returned.
As a method returning -1 cannot be distinguished from a fault in the caller,
use of negative return values for method return values is discouraged.
