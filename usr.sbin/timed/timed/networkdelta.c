 * Compute a corrected date.
 *	Compute the median of the reasonable differences.  First compute
 *	the median of all authorized differences, and then compute the
 *	median of all differences that are reasonably close to the first
 *	median.
 *
 * This differs from the original BSD implementation, which looked for
 *	the largest group of machines with essentially the same date.
 *	That assumed that machines with bad clocks would be uniformly
 *	distributed.  Unfortunately, in real life networks, the distribution
 *	of machines is not uniform among models of machines, and the
 *	distribution of errors in clocks tends to be quite consistent
 *	for a given model.  In other words, all model VI Supre Servres
 *	from GoFast Inc. tend to have about the same error.
 *	The original BSD implementation would chose the clock of the
 *	most common model, and discard all others.
 *
 *	Therefore, get best we can do is to try to average over all
 *	of the machines in the network, while discarding "obviously"
 *	bad values.
