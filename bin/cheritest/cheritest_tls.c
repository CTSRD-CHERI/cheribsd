 * Tests to ensure that Thread-Local Storage (TLS) works as expected.
 * Currently, very limited: just check that pointers and capabilites are
 * suitably aligned by default, and that __aligned works on larger objects.
 * In the future, should test a variety of properties, such as safe access
 * from multiple threads, bounds on TLS variables, etc.  And, likely, also in
 * sandboxes.
