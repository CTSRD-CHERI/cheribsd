 * Some user-level security models rely on strict call-return semantics, which
 * is implemented via a trusted stack in the object-capability invocation
 * path.  This file contains a simple implementation of a CHERI trusted stack
 * for the software exception path.
 *
 * XXXRW: Lots to think about here.
 *
 * 1. How do we want to handle user software models that aren't just
 *    call-return -- e.g., a closure-passing model.  Should the language
 *    runtime be able to rewrite return paths?
 * 2. Do we want some sort of kernel-implemented timeout/resource model, or
 *    just let userspace do it with signals?
 * 3. More generally, how do we want to deal with signals?  (a) switching to
 *    a suitable signal processing context; (b) extending sigcontext_t for
 *    capability state?
 */

/*
 * Initialise the trusted stack of a process (thread) control block.
 *
 * XXXRW: Someday, depth should perhaps be configurable.
 *
 * XXXRW: It makes sense to me that the stack starts empty, and the first
 * CCall populates it with a default return context (e.g., the language
 * runtime).  But does that make sense to anyone else?
 *
 * XXXRW: A fixed-size stack here may or may not be the right thing.

 * Normally, we expect that sandbox libraries will register signal handlers
 * for any traps that might arise within a sandbox, and handle them
 * explicitly.  However, in prototyping, it proves useful if the kernel can
 * 'assist' with unwinding when the signal is not caught: effectively, a
 * forced CReturn.  Unlike normal CReturn, because the caller has not
 * performed a controlled, compiler-directed return, we scrub the user
 * register files to avoid information and rights leakage.  The semantics are
 * a bit poor since we have no way to usefully report it other than frobbing
 * return-register state.  It's not clear that this is really avoidable.
 *
 * XXXRW: Forced return may leave callee invariants violated -- the price for
 * throwing an uncaught signal.  However, it's possible to imagine fail-open
 * scenarios in which a callee with privilege is somehow tricked into
 * throwing an uncaught exception during a window where its invariants are
 * violated, leading to a security vulnerability.  Userspace signal handlers
 * may have more information about how to avoid this and so are preferred; in
 * particular, a userspace runtime might provide a mechanism to allow catching
 * exceptions explicitly rather than always unconditionally unwinding.
 *
 * XXXRW: There's a possible argument for unwinding multiple frames up to the
 * last frame with ambient authority.
