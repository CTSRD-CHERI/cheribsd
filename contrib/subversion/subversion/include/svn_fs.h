/** Filesystem Nodes and Node-Revisions.
 *
 * In a Subversion filesystem, a `node' corresponds roughly to an
 * `inode' in a Unix filesystem:
 * - A node is either a file or a directory.
 * - A node's contents change over time.
 * - When you change a node's contents, it's still the same node; it's
 *   just been changed.  So a node's identity isn't bound to a specific
 *   set of contents.
 * - If you rename a node, it's still the same node, just under a
 *   different name.  So a node's identity isn't bound to a particular
 *   filename.
 *
 * A `node revision' refers to one particular version of a node's contents,
 * that existed over a specific period of time (one or more repository
 * revisions).  Changing a node's contents always creates a new revision of
 * that node, which is to say creates a new `node revision'.  Once created,
 * a node revision's contents never change.
 *
 * When we create a node, its initial contents are the initial revision of
 * the node.  As users make changes to the node over time, we create new
 * revisions of that same node.  When a user commits a change that deletes
 * a file from the filesystem, we don't delete the node, or any revision
 * of it --- those stick around to allow us to recreate prior revisions of
 * the filesystem.  Instead, we just remove the reference to the node
 * from the directory.
 *
 * Each node revision is a part of exactly one node, and appears only once
 * in the history of that node.  It is uniquely identified by a node
 * revision id, #svn_fs_id_t.  Its node revision id also identifies which
 * node it is a part of.
 *
 * @note: Often when we talk about `the node' within the context of a single
 * revision (or transaction), we implicitly mean `the node as it appears in
 * this revision (or transaction)', or in other words `the node revision'.
 *
 * @note: Commonly, a node revision will have the same content as some other
 * node revisions in the same node and in different nodes.  The FS libraries
 * allow different node revisions to share the same data without storing a
 * separate copy of the data.

/** Filesystem Transactions.
 *
 * To make a change to a Subversion filesystem:
 * - Create a transaction object, using svn_fs_begin_txn().
 * - Call svn_fs_txn_root(), to get the transaction's root directory.
 * - Make whatever changes you like in that tree.
 * - Commit the transaction, using svn_fs_commit_txn().
 *
 * The filesystem implementation guarantees that your commit will
 * either:
 * - succeed completely, so that all of the changes are committed to
 *   create a new revision of the filesystem, or
 * - fail completely, leaving the filesystem unchanged.
 *
 * Until you commit the transaction, any changes you make are
 * invisible.  Only when your commit succeeds do they become visible
 * to the outside world, as a new revision of the filesystem.
 *
 * If you begin a transaction, and then decide you don't want to make
 * the change after all (say, because your net connection with the
 * client disappeared before the change was complete), you can call
 * svn_fs_abort_txn(), to cancel the entire transaction; this
 * leaves the filesystem unchanged.
 *
 * The only way to change the contents of files or directories, or
 * their properties, is by making a transaction and creating a new
 * revision, as described above.  Once a revision has been committed, it
 * never changes again; the filesystem interface provides no means to
 * go back and edit the contents of an old revision.  Once history has
 * been recorded, it is set in stone.  Clients depend on this property
 * to do updates and commits reliably; proxies depend on this property
 * to cache changes accurately; and so on.
 *
 * There are two kinds of nodes in the filesystem: mutable, and
 * immutable.  Revisions in the filesystem consist entirely of
 * immutable nodes, whose contents never change.  A transaction in
 * progress, which the user is still constructing, uses mutable nodes
 * for those nodes which have been changed so far, and refers to
 * immutable nodes from existing revisions for portions of the tree
 * which haven't been changed yet in that transaction.
 *
 * Immutable nodes, as part of revisions, never refer to mutable
 * nodes, which are part of uncommitted transactions.  Mutable nodes
 * may refer to immutable nodes, or other mutable nodes.
 *
 * Note that the terms "immutable" and "mutable" describe whether or
 * not the nodes have been changed as part of a transaction --- not
 * the permissions on the nodes they refer to.  Even if you aren't
 * authorized to modify the filesystem's root directory, you might be
 * authorized to change some descendant of the root; doing so would
 * create a new mutable copy of the root directory.  Mutability refers
 * to the role of the node: part of an existing revision, or part of a
 * new one.  This is independent of your authorization to make changes
 * to a given node.
 *
 * Transactions are actually persistent objects, stored in the
 * database.  You can open a filesystem, begin a transaction, and
 * close the filesystem, and then a separate process could open the
 * filesystem, pick up the same transaction, and continue work on it.
 * When a transaction is successfully committed, it is removed from
 * the database.
 *
 * Every transaction is assigned a name.  You can open a transaction
 * by name, and resume work on it, or find out the name of a
 * transaction you already have open.  You can also list all the
 * transactions currently present in the database.
 *
 * You may assign properties to transactions; these are name/value
 * pairs.  When you commit a transaction, all of its properties become
 * unversioned revision properties of the new revision.  (There is one
 * exception: the svn:date property will be automatically set on new
 * transactions to the date that the transaction was created, and can
 * be overwritten when the transaction is committed by the current
 * time; see svn_fs_commit_txn.)
 *
 * Transaction names are guaranteed to contain only letters (upper-
 * and lower-case), digits, `-', and `.', from the ASCII character
 * set.
 *
 * The Subversion filesystem will make a best effort to not reuse
 * transaction names.  The Berkeley DB backend generates transaction
 * names using a sequence, or a counter, which is stored in the BDB
 * database.  Each new transaction increments the counter.  The
 * current value of the counter is not serialized into a filesystem
 * dump file, so dumping and restoring the repository will reset the
 * sequence and reuse transaction names.  The FSFS backend generates a
 * transaction name using the hostname, process ID and current time in
 * microseconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970 UTC.  So it is
 * extremely unlikely that a transaction name will be reused.

 * with slash characters.  Sequences of two or more consecutive slash
 * characters are treated as if they were a single slash.  If a path
 * ends with a slash, it refers to the same node it would without the
 * slash, but that node must be a directory, or else the function
 * returns an SVN_ERR_FS_NOT_DIRECTORY error.

 *
 * Notes:
 *    - Copy ancestry does not descend.  After copying directory D to
 *      E, E will have copy ancestry referring to D, but E's children
 *      may not.  See also svn_fs_copy().
 *
 *    - Copy ancestry *under* a copy is preserved.  That is, if you
 *      copy /A/D/G/pi to /A/D/G/pi2, and then copy /A/D/G to /G, then
 *      /G/pi2 will still have copy ancestry pointing to /A/D/G/pi.
 *      We don't know if this is a feature or a bug yet; if it turns
 *      out to be a bug, then the fix is to make svn_fs_copied_from()
 *      observe the following logic, which currently callers may
 *      choose to follow themselves: if node X has copy history, but
 *      its ancestor A also has copy history, then you may ignore X's
 *      history if X's revision-of-origin is earlier than A's --
 *      because that would mean that X's copy history was preserved in
 *      a copy-under-a-copy scenario.  If X's revision-of-origin is
 *      the same as A's, then it was copied under A during the same
 *      transaction that created A.  (X's revision-of-origin cannot be
 *      greater than A's, if X has copy history.)  @todo See how
 *      people like this, it can always be hidden behind the curtain
 *      if necessary.
 *
 *    - Copy ancestry is not stored as a regular subversion property
 *      because it is not inherited.  Copying foo to bar results in a
 *      revision of bar with copy ancestry; but committing a text
 *      change to bar right after that results in a new revision of
 *      bar without copy ancestry.
