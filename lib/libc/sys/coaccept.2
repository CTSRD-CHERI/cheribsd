.Dt COACCEPT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm COACCEPT
.Nd accept a colocated call
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn coaccept "void * __capability * __capability cookiep" "const void * __capability outbuf" "size_t outlen" "void * __capability inbuf" "size_t inlen"
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn coaccept_slow "void * __capability * __capability cookiep" "const void * __capability outbuf" "size_t outlen" "void * __capability inbuf" "size_t inlen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn coaccept
function accepts a colocated call.
Before passing execution to the callee, at most
.Fa outlen
bytes pointed to by
.Fa outbuf
will be copied from the input buffer provided by the caller.
Before returning to the caller,
.Fa outlen
bytes pointed to by
.Fa outbuf
will be copied back to the caller.
Any capabilities copied will have their tag bits preserved.
The
.Fn coaccept_slow 2
provides the same semantics, but implemented as a traditional system call.
.Pp
If
.Ar cookiep
is not NULL, the capability it points at will be set to an opaque,
token that uniquely identifies the caller; the token can be passed to
.Xr cogetpid 2 .
The
.Fa outbuf ,
.Fa inbuf ,
.Fa outlen ,
and
.Fa inlen
values must be 8-byte aligned.
.Pp
Before calling those functions for the first time, one must call
.Xr cosetup 2
with
.Dv COSETUP_COACCEPT
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion the number of bytes copied into
.Fa inbuf
is returned.
Otherwise a -1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn coaccept
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa inbuf
or
.Fa outbuf
arguments point outside the process's allocated address space,
or the
.Fa inlen
or
.Fa outlen
reach beyond the allocated memory.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Basic usage example:
.Bd -literal
	uint64_t buf[MAXBSIZE];
	ssize_t received;

	error = cosetup(COSETUP_COACCEPT);
	if (error != 0)
		err(1, "cosetup");

	error = coregister("target-name", NULL);
	if (error != 0)
		err(1, "coregister");

	memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));

	for (;;) {
		received = coaccept(NULL, buf, sizeof(buf), buf, sizeof(buf));
		if (received < 0)
			err(1, "coaccept");
	}
