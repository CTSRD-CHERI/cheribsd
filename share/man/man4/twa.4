.Sh NAME
.Nm twa
.Nd 3ware 9000/9500/9550/9650 series SATA RAID controllers driver
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
The
.Nm
driver is not present in
.Fx 13.0 .
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device twa"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
twa_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for AMCC's 3ware 9000/9500/9550/9650 series
SATA controllers.
.Pp
These controllers are available in 4, 8, 12 or 16-port configurations,
and support the following RAID levels: 0, 1, 10, 5, 50.
The device nodes for the controllers are of the form
.Pa /dev/twa Ns Ar X ,
where
.Ar X
is the controller number.
The driver is implemented as a SCSI SIM
under CAM, and, as such, the logical units that it controls are accessible
via the device nodes,
.Pa /dev/da Ns Ar Y ,
where
.Ar Y
is the logical unit number.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following SATA RAID controllers:

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Whenever the driver encounters a command failure, it prints out an error code in
the format:
.Qq Li "ERROR: (<error source>: <error code>):" ,
followed by a text description of the error.
There are other error messages and warnings that the
driver prints out, depending on the kinds of errors that it encounters.
If the driver is compiled with
.Dv TWA_DEBUG
defined, it prints out a whole bunch of debug
messages, the quantity of which varies depending on the value assigned to
.Dv TWA_DEBUG
(0 to 10).

.Nm
driver and manpage were written by
