.Nm bhyveload
.Nd load a
.Fx
guest inside a bhyve virtual machine
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl C
.Op Fl S
.Op Fl c Ar cons-dev
.Op Fl d Ar disk-path
.Op Fl e Ar name=value
.Op Fl h Ar host-path
.Op Fl l Ar os-loader
.Op Fl m Ar memsize Ns Op Ar K|k|M|m|G|g|T|t
.Ar vmname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to load a
.Fx
guest inside a
.Xr bhyve 4
virtual machine.
.Pp
.Nm
is based on
.Xr loader 8
and will present an interface identical to the
.Fx
loader on the user's terminal.
This behavior can be changed by specifying a different OS loader.
.Pp
The virtual machine is identified as
.Ar vmname
and will be created if it does not already exist.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar cons-dev
.Ar cons-dev
is a
.Xr tty 4
device to use for
.Nm
terminal I/O.
.Pp
The text string "stdio" is also accepted and selects the use of
unbuffered standard I/O. This is the default value.
.It Fl d Ar disk-path
The
.Ar disk-path
is the pathname of the guest's boot disk image.
.It Fl e Ar name=value
Set the
.Fx
loader environment variable
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
.Pp
The option may be used more than once to set more than one environment
variable.
.It Fl h Ar host-path
The
.Ar host-path
is the directory at the top of the guest's boot filesystem.
.It Fl l Ar os-loader
Specify a different OS loader.
By default
.Nm
will use
.Pa /boot/userboot.so ,
which presents a standard
.Fx
loader.
.It Fl m Ar memsize Ns Op Ar K|k|M|m|G|g|T|t
.Ar memsize
is the amount of memory allocated to the guest.
.Pp
The
.Ar memsize
argument may be suffixed with one of
.Cm K ,
.Cm M ,
.Cm G
or
.Cm T
(either upper or lower case) to indicate a multiple of
Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes or Terabytes
respectively.
.Pp
.Ar memsize
defaults to 256M.
.It Fl C
Include guest memory in the core file when
.Nm
dumps core.
This is intended for debugging an OS loader as it allows inspection of
the guest memory.
.It Fl S
Wire guest memory.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a virtual machine named
.Ar freebsd-vm
that boots off the ISO image
.Pa /freebsd/release.iso
and has 1GB memory allocated to it:
.Pp
.Dl "bhyveload -m 1G -d /freebsd/release.iso freebsd-vm"
.Pp
To create a virtual machine named
.Ar test-vm
with 256MB of memory allocated, the guest root filesystem under the host
directory
.Pa /user/images/test
and terminal I/O sent to the
.Xr nmdm 4
device
.Pa /dev/nmdm1B
.Pp
.Dl "bhyveload -m 256MB -h /usr/images/test -c /dev/nmdm1B test-vm"

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Fx 10.0 ,
and was developed at NetApp Inc.

.Nm
was developed by

.An Neel Natu Aq Mt neel@FreeBSD.org
at NetApp Inc with a lot of help from
.An Doug Rabson Aq Mt dfr@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
can only load
.Fx
as a guest.
