.Nd home-link file system daemon

.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl i Ar reload-interval
.Op Fl l Ar logfile
.Op Fl o Ar mount-options

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This daemon is obsolete.
Users are advised to use
.Xr autofs 5
instead.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
is a daemon which implements a file system containing a symbolic link to
subdirectory within a user's home directory, depending on the user
which accessed that link.
It was primarily designed to redirect
incoming mail to users' home directories, so that it can read from
anywhere.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
operates by mounting itself as an NFS server for the directory containing
.Ar linkname ,
which defaults to
.Pa /hlfs/home .
Lookups within that directory are handled by
.Nm ,
which uses the password map to determine how to resolve the lookup.
The directory will be created if it does not already exist.
The symbolic link will be to the accessing user's home directory, with
.Ar subdir
appended to it.
If not specified,
.Ar subdir
defaults to
.Pa .hlfsdir .
This directory will also be created if it does not already exist.
.Pp
A
.Dv SIGTERM
sent to
.Nm
will cause it to shutdown.
A
.Dv SIGHUP
will flush the internal
caches, and reload the password map.
It will also close and
reopen the log file, to enable the original log file to be
removed or rotated.
A
.Dv SIGUSR1
will cause it to dump its internal
table of user IDs and home directories to the file
.Pa /usr/tmp/hlfsd.dump.XXXXXX .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar alt_dir
Alternate directory.
The name of the directory to which
the symbolic link returned by
.Nm
will point, if it cannot access the home directory of the user.
This
defaults to
.Pa /var/hlfs .
This directory will be created if it does not exist.
It is expected
that either users will read these files, or the system administrators
will run a script to resend this
.Dq lost mail
to its owner.
.It Fl c Ar cache-interval
Caching interval.
The
.Nm
utility
will cache the validity of home directories for this interval, in
seconds.
Entries which have been verified within the last
.Ar cache-interval
seconds will not be verified again, since the operation could
be expensive, and the entries are most likely still valid.
After the interval has expired,
.Nm
will re-verify the validity of the user's home directory, and
reset the cache time-counter.
The default value for
.Ar cache-interval
is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
.It Fl f
Force fast startup.
This option tells
.Nm
to skip startup-time consistency checks such as existence of mount
directory, alternate spool directory, symlink to be hidden under the
mount directory, their permissions and validity.
.It Fl g Ar group
Set the special group
.Dv HLFS_GID
to
.Ar group .
Programs such as
.Xr comsat 8 ,
(which access the mailboxes of other users) must be setgid
.Dv HLFS_GID
to work properly.
The default group is
.Dq Li hlfs .
If no group is provided,
and there is no group
.Dq Li hlfs ,
this feature is disabled.
.It Fl h
Help.
Print a brief help message, and exit.
.It Fl i Ar reload-interval
Map-reloading interval.
Each
.Ar reload-interval
seconds,
.Nm
will reload the password map.
The
.Nm
utility
needs the password map for the UIDs and home directory pathnames.
The
.Nm
utility schedules a
.Dv SIGALRM
to reload the password maps.
A
.Dv SIGHUP
sent to
.Nm
will force it to reload the maps immediately.
The default
value for
.Ar reload-interval
is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
.It Fl l Ar logfile
Specify a log file to which
.Nm
will record events.
If
.Ar logfile
is the string
.Dq Li syslog
then the log messages will be sent to the system log daemon by
.Xr syslog 3 ,
using the
.Dv LOG_DAEMON
facility.
This is also the default.
.It Fl n
No verify.
The
.Nm
utility
will not verify the validity of the symbolic link it will be
returning, or that the user's home directory contains
sufficient disk-space for spooling.
This can speed up
.Nm
at the cost of possibly returning symbolic links to home
directories which are not currently accessible or are full.
By default,
.Nm
validates the symbolic-link in the background.
The
.Fl n
option overrides the meaning of the
.Fl c
option, since no caching is necessary.
.It Fl o Ar mount-options
Mount options.
Mount options which
.Nm
will use to mount itself on top of
.Ar dirname .
By default,
.Ar mount-options
is set to
.Dq Li ro .
If the system supports symbolic-link caching, default
options are set to
.Dq Li ro,nocache .
.It Fl p
Print PID.
Outputs the process ID of
.Nm
to standard output where it can be saved into a file.
.It Fl v
Version.
Displays version information to standard error.
.It Fl x Ar log-options
Specify run-time logging options.
The options are a comma separated
list chosen from:
.Li fatal , error , user , warn , info , map , stats , all .
.It Fl C
Force
.Nm
to run on systems that cannot turn off the NFS attribute-cache.
Use of
this option on those systems is discouraged, as it may result in loss
or mis-delivery of mail.
The option is ignored on systems that can turn
off the attribute-cache.
.It Fl D Ar log-options
Select from a variety of debugging options.
Prefixing an
option with the string
.Dq Li no
reverses the effect of that option.
Options are cumulative.
The most useful option is
.Dq Li all .
Since this option is only used for debugging other options are not
documented here.
A fuller description is available in the program
source.
A
.Dv SIGUSR1
sent to
.Nm
will cause it to dump its internal password map to the file
.Pa /usr/tmp/hlfsd.dump.XXXXXX .
.It Fl P Ar password-file
Read the user-name, user-id, and home directory information from the file
.Ar password-file .
Normally,
.Nm
will use
.Xr getpwent 3
to read the password database.
This option allows you to override the
default database, and is useful if you want to map users' mail files to a
directory other than their home directory.
Only the username, uid, and
home-directory fields of the file
.Ar password-file
are read and checked.
All other fields are ignored.
The file
.Ar password-file
must otherwise be compliant with
.Ux
System 7 colon-delimited format
.Xr passwd 5 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /var/hlfs"
.It Pa /hlfs
directory under which
.Nm
mounts itself and manages the symbolic link
.Pa home .
.It Pa .hlfsdir
default sub-directory in the user's home directory, to which the
.Pa home
symbolic link returned by
.Nm
points.
.It Pa /var/hlfs
directory to which
.Pa home
symbolic link returned by
.Nm
points if it is unable to verify the that
user's home directory is accessible.
