# Tests for the variable modifiers ':On', which returns the words, sorted in
# ascending numeric order, and for ':Orn' and ':Onr', which additionally
# reverse the order.
#
# The variable modifiers ':On', ':Onr' and ':Orn' were added in var.c 1.939
# from 2021-07-30.

# This list contains only 32-bit numbers since the make code needs to conform
# to C90, which does not necessarily provide integer types larger than 32 bit.
# Make uses 'long long' for C99 or later, and 'long' for older C versions.
#
# To get 53-bit integers even in C90, it would be possible to switch to
# 'double' instead, but that would allow floating-point numbers as well, which
# is out of scope for this variable modifier.
