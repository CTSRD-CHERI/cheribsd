 * Everywhere below the "caller" and "callee" terms are swapped.
 * In other words, the "caller" here is the same thread as the "caller"
 * on the cocall(2) side.  We - the thread calling into coaccept(2) - are
 * called the callee here.
 *
 * Register usage: we save and restore csp and cra.  The rest gets zeroed;
 * the libc wrappers are responsible for saving and restoring the context.
 *
 * Note that this code executes while ignoring all the signals - a trapping
 * instruction will just get skipped over.
 *
 * Layout of struct switchercb, pointed to by idc (callee side)
 * and, later on, ct0 (caller side):

 * scb_td:		2*CHERICAP_SIZE(idc)
 * scb_borrower_td:	2*CHERICAP_SIZE+8(idc)
 * scb_unsealcap:	3*CHERICAP_SIZE(idc)
