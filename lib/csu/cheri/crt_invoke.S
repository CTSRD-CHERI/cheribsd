#
# CHERI sandbox runtime startup code -- begins execution inside a sandbox and
# is responsible for bootstrapping MIPS-compiled C code (without CHERI
# extensions).
#
# Expectations on the CCall mechanism
#    $c1, $c2 contain the sealed invoked code and data capability
#    $pcc contains the unsealed invoked code capability
#    $idc contains the unsealed invoked data capability
#
# Expectations on the caller
#    $v0 contains the method number (if any)
#    $a0-$a7 will contain non-capability arguments
#    $c3-$c10 will contain capability arguments
#
# Expectations on the class code and instance setup:
#    $c0, $pcc contain access to (100% overlapped) sandbox code and data
#
# Things that will be set up for the callee C code
#    $c0, $c11 will be set up to match the class
#    $c11 will have have the global bit cleared
#    $sp, $fp will point into an in-sandbox stack, relative to $c11
#
# __invoke_vector will jump to the 'invoke' symbol and arrange a CReturn when
# that function returns.  This code also implements 'abort' and '_exit'
# symbols that can be used to fall back out quickly and efficiently.
#
# On return:
#    $v0, $v1 will contain non-capability return values
#    $c3 will contain a capability return value
#
# Sandbox heap information is extracted from the sandbox metadata structure.
# $c26 is assumed to have room for a stack at the top, although its length is
# currently undefined.
#
# For now, assume:
# (1) The caller has not set up the general-purpose register context, that's
#     our job.
# (2) The goal is not to set up the CHERI calling convention .. yet; we will
#     run only native MIPS64 code, or hand-crafted CHERI assembler.  Thus
#     must change before we can run Clang-compiled CHERI code.
