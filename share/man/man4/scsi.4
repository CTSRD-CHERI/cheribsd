.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
subsystem provides a uniform and modular system for the implementation
of drivers to control various
.Tn SCSI ,
.Tn ATA ,
.Tn NMVe ,
and
.Tn MMC / SD
devices, and to utilize different
.Tn SCSI ,
.Tn ATA ,
.Tn NVMe ,
and
.Tn MMC / SD
host adapters through host adapter drivers.
When the system probes buses, it attaches any devices it finds to the
appropriate drivers.
The
.Xr pass 4
driver, if it is configured in the kernel, will attach to all devices.
.Sh KERNEL CONFIGURATION
There are a number of generic kernel configuration options for the
.Nm
subsystem:
.Bl -tag -width SCSI_NO_SENSE_STRINGS
.It Dv CAMDEBUG
This option compiles in all the
.Nm
debugging printf code.
This will not actually
cause any debugging information to be printed out when included by itself.
See below for details.
.It Dv "CAM_MAX_HIGHPOWER=4"
This sets the maximum allowable number of concurrent "high power" commands.
A "high power" command is a command that takes more electrical power than
most to complete.
An example of this is the
.Tn SCSI
START UNIT command.
Starting a disk often takes significantly more electrical power than normal
operation.
This option allows the
user to specify how many concurrent high power commands may be outstanding
without overloading the power supply on his computer.
.It Dv SCSI_NO_SENSE_STRINGS
This eliminates text descriptions of each
.Tn SCSI
Additional Sense Code and Additional Sense Code Qualifier pair.
Since this
is a fairly large text database, eliminating it reduces the size of the
kernel somewhat.
This is primarily necessary for boot floppies and other
low disk space or low memory space environments.
In most cases, though,
this should be enabled, since it speeds the interpretation of
.Tn SCSI
error messages.
Do not let the "kernel bloat" zealots get to you -- leave
the sense descriptions in your kernel!
.It Dv SCSI_NO_OP_STRINGS
This disables text descriptions of each
.Tn SCSI
opcode.
This option, like the sense string option above, is primarily
useful for environments like a boot floppy where kernel size is critical.
Enabling this option for normal use is not recommended, since it slows
debugging of
.Tn SCSI
problems.
.It Dv SCSI_DELAY=8000
This is the
.Tn SCSI
"bus settle delay."
In
.Nm ,
it is specified in
.Em milliseconds ,
not seconds like the old
.Tn SCSI
layer used to do.
When the kernel boots, it sends a bus reset to each
.Tn SCSI
bus to tell each device to reset itself to a default set of transfer
negotiations and other settings.
Most
.Tn SCSI
devices need some amount of time to recover from a bus reset.
Newer disks
may need as little as 100ms, while old, slow devices may need much longer.
If the
.Dv SCSI_DELAY
is not specified, it defaults to 2 seconds.
The minimum allowable value for
.Dv SCSI_DELAY
is "100", or 100ms.
One special case is that if the
.Dv SCSI_DELAY
is set to 0, that will be taken to mean the "lowest possible value."
In that case, the
.Dv SCSI_DELAY
will be reset to 100ms.
.El
.Pp
All devices and buses support dynamic allocation so that
an upper number of devices and controllers does not need to be configured;
.Cd "device da"
will suffice for any number of disk drivers.
.Pp
The devices are either
.Em wired
so they appear as a particular device unit or
.Em counted
so that they appear as the next available unused unit.
.Pp
Units are wired down by setting kernel environment hints.
This is usually done either interactively from the
.Xr loader 8 ,
or automatically via the
.Pa /boot/device.hints
file.
The basic syntax is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hint.device.unit.property="value"
.Ed
.Pp
Individual
.Nm
bus numbers can be wired down to specific controllers with
a config line similar to the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hint.scbus.0.at="ahd1"
.Ed
.Pp
This assigns
.Nm
bus number 0 to the
.Em ahd1
driver instance.
For controllers supporting more than one bus, a particular bus can be assigned
as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hint.scbus.0.at="ahc1"
hint.scbus.0.bus="1"
.Ed
.Pp
This assigns
.Nm
bus 0 to the bus 1 instance on
.Em ahc1 .
Peripheral drivers can be wired to a specific bus, target, and lun as so:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hint.da.0.at="scbus0"
hint.da.0.target="0"
hint.da.0.unit="0"
.Ed
.Pp
This assigns
.Em da0
to target 0, unit (lun) 0 of scbus 0.
Omitting the target or unit hints will instruct
.Nm
to treat them as wildcards
and use the first respective counted instances.
These examples can be combined together to allow a peripheral device to be
wired to any particular controller, bus, target, and/or unit instance.
.Pp
This also works with
.Xr nvme 4
drives as well.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hint.nvme.4.at="pci7:0:0"
hint.scbus.10.at="nvme4"
hint.nda.10.at="scbus10"
hint.nda.10.target="1"
hint.nda.10.unit="12"
hint.nda.11.at="scbus10"
hint.nda.11.target="1"
hint.nda.11.unit="2"
.Ed
.Pp
This assigns the NVMe card living at PCI bus 7 to scbus 10 (in PCIe,
slot and function are rarely used and usually 0).
The target for
.Xr nda 4
devices is always 1.
The unit is the namespace identifier from the drive.
The namespace id 1 is exported as
.Tn nda10
and namespace id 2 is exported as
.Tn nda11 .
.Pp
When you have a mixture of wired down and counted devices then the
counting begins with the first non-wired down unit for a particular
type.
That is, if you have a disk wired down as
.Em "device da1" ,
then the first non-wired disk shall come on line as
.Em da2 .
.Sh ADAPTERS
The system allows common device drivers to work through many different
types of adapters.
The adapters take requests from the upper layers and do
all IO between the
.Tn SCSI ,
.Tn ATA ,
.Tn NVMe ,
or
.Tn MMC / SD
bus and the system.
The maximum size of a transfer is governed by the
adapter.
Most adapters can transfer 64KB in a single operation, however
many can transfer larger amounts.
.Sh TARGET MODE
Some adapters support
.Em target mode
in which the system is capable of operating as a device, responding to
operations initiated by another system.
Target mode is supported for
some adapters, but is not yet complete for this version of the
.Nm
.Tn SCSI
subsystem.
.Sh FILES
see other
.Nm
device entries.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
An XPT_DEBUG CCB can be used to enable various amounts of tracing information
on any specific bus/device from the list of options compiled into the kernel.
There are currently seven debugging flags that may be compiled in and used:
.Bl -tag -width CAM_DEBUG_SUBTRACE
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_INFO
This flag enables general informational printfs for the device
or devices in question.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_TRACE
This flag enables function-level command flow tracing i.e.,
kernel printfs will happen at the entrance and exit of various functions.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_SUBTRACE
This flag enables debugging output internal to various functions.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_CDB
This flag will cause the kernel to print out all
.Tn ATA
and
.Tn SCSI
commands sent to a particular device or devices.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_XPT
This flag will enable command scheduler tracing.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_PERIPH
This flag will enable peripheral drivers messages.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_PROBE
This flag will enable devices probe process tracing.
.El
.Pp
Some of these flags, most notably
.Dv CAM_DEBUG_TRACE
and
.Dv CAM_DEBUG_SUBTRACE ,
will produce kernel printfs in EXTREME numbers.
.Pp
Users can enable debugging from their kernel config file, by using
the following kernel config options:
.Bl -tag -width CAM_DEBUG_COMPILE
.It Dv CAMDEBUG
This builds into the kernel all possible
.Nm
debugging.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_COMPILE
This allows to specify support for which debugging flags described above
should be built into the kernel.
Flags may be ORed together if the user wishes to
see printfs for multiple debugging levels.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_FLAGS
This allows to set the various debugging flags from a kernel config file.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_BUS
Specify a bus to debug.
To debug all buses, set this to -1.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_TARGET
Specify a target to debug.
To debug all targets, set this to -1.
.It Dv CAM_DEBUG_LUN
Specify a lun to debug.
To debug all luns, set this to -1.
.El
.Pp
Users may also enable debugging on the fly by using the
.Xr camcontrol 8
utility, if wanted options built into the kernel.
See
.Xr camcontrol 8
for details.
