# Our current make(1)-based approach to dependency tracking cannot cope with
# certain source tree changes, including:
# - removing source files
# - replacing generated files with files committed to the tree
# - changing file extensions (e.g. a C source file rewritten in C++)
#
# We handle those cases here in an ad-hoc fashion by looking for the known-
# bad case in the main .depend file, and if found deleting all of the related
# .depend files (including for example the lib32 version).
