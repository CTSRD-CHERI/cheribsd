 *            via xge_hal_fifo_dtr_post() or xge_hal_ring_dtr_post().

 * Service Routine.
 *
 * Channel callback gets called by HAL if, and only if, there is at least
 * one new completion on a given ring or fifo channel. Upon processing the
 * first @dtrh ULD is _supposed_ to continue consuming completions
 * using one of the following HAL APIs:
 *    - xge_hal_fifo_dtr_next_completed()
 *      or
 *    - xge_hal_ring_dtr_next_completed().
 *
 * Note that failure to process new completions in a timely fashion
 * leads to XGE_HAL_INF_OUT_OF_DESCRIPTORS condition.
 *
 * Non-zero @t_code means failure to process (transmit or receive, depending
 * on the channel type) the descriptor.
 *
 * In the "transmit" case the failure could happen, for instance, when the
 * link is down, in which case Xframe completes the descriptor because it
 * is not able to send the data out.
 *
 * For details please refer to Xframe User Guide.

 *               position in the channel, which will contain next
 *               to-be-completed descriptor.
 * @length: Channel length. Currently allocated number of descriptors.
 *          The channel length "grows" when more descriptors get allocated.
 *          See _hal_mempool_grow.
 * @free_arr: Free array. Contains completed descriptors that were freed
 *            (i.e., handed over back to HAL) by ULD.
 *            See xge_hal_fifo_dtr_free(), xge_hal_ring_dtr_free().
 * @free_lock: Lock to protect @free_arr.
 * ----------- reserve/post section ---------------
 * @post_index: Post index. At any point in time points on the
 *              position in the channel, which'll contain next to-be-posted
 *              descriptor.

 *             on the given channel.
 * @reserve_arr: Reserve array. Contains descriptors that can be reserved

 *               See xge_hal_fifo_dtr_reserve(),
 *               xge_hal_ring_dtr_reserve().
 * @reserve_length: Length of the @reserve_arr. The length dynamically
 *                  changes: it decrements each time descriptor is reserved.
 * @reserve_lock: Lock to serialize multiple concurrent threads accessing
 *                @reserve_arr.
 * @reserve_threshold: Reserve threshold. Minimal number of free descriptors
 *                     that ought to be preserved in the channel at all times.
 *                     Note that @reserve_threshold >= 0 &&

 * @devh: Device handle. HAL device object that contains _this_ channel.
 * @dmah: Channel's DMA address. Used to synchronize (to/from device)
 *        descriptors.
 * @regh0: Base address of the device memory space handle. Copied from HAL device
 *         at channel open time.
 * @regh1: Base address of the device memory space handle. Copied from HAL device
 *         at channel open time.
 * @userdata: Per-channel opaque (void*) user-defined context, which may be
 *            upper-layer driver object, ULP connection, etc.
 *            Once channel is open, @userdata is passed back to user via
 *            xge_hal_channel_callback_f.
 * @work_arr: Work array. Contains descriptors posted to the channel.
 *            Note that at any point in time @work_arr contains 3 types of
 *            descriptors:
 *            1) posted but not yet consumed by Xframe device;
 *            2) consumed but not yet completed;
 *            3) completed but not yet freed
 *            (via xge_hal_fifo_dtr_free() or xge_hal_ring_dtr_free())
 * @saved_arr: Array used internally to optimize channel full-duplex
 *             operation.
 * @stats: Channel statistcis. Includes HAL internal counters, including
 *         for instance, number of times out-of-descriptors
 *         (see XGE_HAL_INF_OUT_OF_DESCRIPTORS) condition happened.
 * ------------- "slow" section  ------------------
 * @type: Channel type. See xge_hal_channel_type_e{}.
 * @vp_id: Virtual path id
 * @post_qid: Identifies Xframe queue used for posting descriptors.

 * @reserve_initial: Initial number of descriptors allocated at channel open
 *                   time (see xge_hal_channel_open()). The number of
 *                   channel descriptors can grow at runtime
 *                   up to @reserve_max value.
 * @reserve_max: Maximum number of channel descriptors. See @reserve_initial.
 * @is_open: True, if channel is open; false - otherwise.
 * @per_dtr_space: Per-descriptor space (in bytes) that channel user can utilize
 *                 to store per-operation control information.
 * HAL channel object. HAL devices (see xge_hal_device_t{}) contains
 * zero or more channels. HAL channel contains zero or more descriptors. The

 * to remote peer(s) via the channel.
