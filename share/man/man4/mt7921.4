.Sh NAME
.Nm mt7921
.Nd MediaTek IEEE 802.11ax wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
The driver will auto-load without any user interaction using
.Xr devmatch 8
if enabled in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.Pp
Only if auto-loading is explicitly disabled, place the following
lines in
.Xr rc.conf 5
to manually load the driver as a module at boot time:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kld_list="${kld_list} if_mt7921"
.Ed
.Pp
The driver should automatically load any
firmware needed for the particular chipset.
.Pp
It is discouraged to load the driver from
.Xr loader 8 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is derived from MediaTek's Linux mt76 driver and provides support for
the following chipsets:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It MediaTek MT7921E (PCIe)
.El
.Pp
This driver requires firmware to be loaded before it will work.
The package
.Pa wifi-firmware-mt76-kmod
from the
.Pa ports/net/wifi-firmware-mt76-kmod
port needs to be installed before the driver is loaded.
Otherwise no
.Xr wlan 4
interface can be created using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The driver uses the
.\" No LinuxKPI man pages so no .Xr here.
.Em linuxkpi_wlan
and
.Em linuxkpi
compat framework to bridge between the Linux and
native
.Fx
driver code as well as to the native
.Xr net80211 4
wireless stack.
.Pp
While
.Nm
supports all 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and ax
the compatibility code currently only supports 802.11 a/b/g modes.
Support for 802.11 n/ac is to come.
.Sh BUGS
Certainly.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wlan 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 14.0 .
