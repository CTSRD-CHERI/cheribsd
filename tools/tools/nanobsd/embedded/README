$FreeBSD$

Example for creating many different builds (including different
arch) from a common set of files, as well as building natively
using qemu user space emulation.

This creates a simple appliance that uses dnsmasq to serve DNS
and DHCPd.

This is a work in progress. Generally, to build this you should
     cd tools/tools/nanobsd/embedded
     sudo sh ../nanobsd.sh -c foo.cfg

Some features:

Image size is minimal, we grow the last partition on first boot to
fill the media.

Images are both as easy as possible to construct, as well as easy as
possible to expand.

Config			Short description

sam9260ek.cfg		Create a bootable image for an Atmel SAM9260-EK
			evaluation board (still needs a kernel loaded
			into dataflash or NAND, so experimental).
sam9g20ek.cfg		Create a bootable image for an Atmel SAM9G20-EK
			evaluation board (still needs a kernel loaded
			into dataflash or NAND, so experimental). Also
			works on many after-market boards that are somewhat
			compatible with the references board.
