.Sh NAME
.Nm aha
.Nd Adaptec SCSI host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device aha"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
aha_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
In
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.aha.0.at="isa"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the
.Tn SCSI
bus connected to the Adaptec AHA-154x SCSI host adapters.
x is 0 for controllers without a floppy drive and 2 for controllers
that have them.
.Pp
One device hint entry for every card to be attached by the system is
required.
Specific values for the port address, IRQ, and DRQ may be specified.
If wildcard values are used, the driver will query the device for its
current settings and use those.
If the port address
is a wildcard, the driver consults an internal table of possible port address
locations and attaches to the first unattached card it finds.
The possible
port addresses for this card are 0x330, 0x334, 0x230, 0x234, 0x130, and
0x134.

.Nm
driver supports the following SCSI host adapters:

.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was ported by
.An M. Warner Losh
from the
.Nm bt
driver written by
.An Justin T. Gibbs .
.Sh BUGS
The AHA-154xA card does not support residuals on data transfers.
As a result, this card is no longer supported.
.Pp
There have been some reports that the AHA-154xB does not work well
under heavy load.
.Pp
The AHA-154xCP is a plug and play controller.
However, its resources are set using the on-board BIOS and cannot be
moved.
Failures to attached for this card are often caused when the resources
set in the BIOS conflict.
