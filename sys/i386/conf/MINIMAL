#
# MINIMAL -- Mostly Minimal kernel configuration file for FreeBSD/i386
#
# Many definitions of minimal are possible. The one this file follows is
# GENERIC, minus all functionality that can be replaced by loading kernel
# modules.
#
# Exceptions:
# o While UFS is buildable as a module, the current module lacks
#   some features (ACL, GJOURNAL) that GENERIC includes.
# o acpi as a module has been reported flakey and not well tested, so
#   is included in the kernel.
# o (non-loaded) random is included due to uncertainty...
# o Many networking things are included
#
# For now, please run changes to these list past imp@freebsd.org
#
# For more information on this file, please read the config(5) manual page,
# and/or the handbook section on Kernel Configuration Files:
#
#    https://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig-config.html
#
# The handbook is also available locally in /usr/share/doc/handbook
# if you've installed the doc distribution, otherwise always see the
# FreeBSD World Wide Web server (https://www.FreeBSD.org/) for the
# latest information.
#
# An exhaustive list of options and more detailed explanations of the
# device lines is also present in the ../../conf/NOTES and NOTES files.
# If you are in doubt as to the purpose or necessity of a line, check first
# in NOTES.
