# Tests for variable modifiers, such as :Q, :S,from,to or :Ufallback.
#
# See also:
#	varparse-errors.mk

# As of 2022-08-06, the possible behaviors during parsing are:
#
# * `strict`: the parsing style used by most modifiers:
#   * either uses `ParseModifierPart` or parses the modifier literal
#   * other modifiers may follow, separated by a ':'
#
# * `greedy`: calls `ParseModifierPart` with `ch->endc`; this means
#   that no further modifiers are parsed in that expression.
#
# * `no-colon`: after parsing this modifier, the following modifier
#   does not need to be separated by a colon.
#   Omitting this colon is bad style.
#
# * `individual`: parsing this modifier does not follow the common
#   pattern of calling `ParseModifierPart`.
#
# The SysV column says whether a parse error in the modifier falls back
# trying the `:from=to` System V modifier.
