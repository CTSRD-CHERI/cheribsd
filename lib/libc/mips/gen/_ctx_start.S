/*
 * This requires makecontext() to setup a valid GP for locating
 * _ctx_done rather than deriving GP from T9 on entry.  Currently this
 * uses the GP inherited from getcontext() assuming that getcontext()
 * is in the same shared object as _ctx_done().  For N32 and N64, GP
 * is caller-save so will be preserved across the call to the callback
 * function.  For O32, GP is callee-save, so save it in a different
 * caller-save register (S1) while invoking the callback.  This is
 * done instead of the usual SETUP_GP/SAVE_GP to avoid disturbing the
 * stack frame setup by makecontext() for the callback function.
