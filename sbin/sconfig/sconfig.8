.Sh NAME
.Nm sconfig
.Nd "channel configuration utility for Cronyx adapters"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aimsxeftuc
.Op Ar device
.Op Ar data_rate_options
.Op Ar protocol_options ...
.Op Ar interface_options ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used for configuring the channel options of the Cronyx
adapters.
In asynchronous mode, all parameters should be set using the standard
.Xr stty 1
utility.
With
.Nm ,
it is only possible to set some of them (see below).
.Pp
Some of the options can be set only on free channels,
that is when the corresponding network interface is in the
.Cm down
state in the synchronous mode,
and the terminal device
.Pa /dev/tty*
is closed in asynchronous mode.
.Pp
Other channel options can be changed
.Dq "on the fly" .
Generally, the channel options are set up during the operating system startup,
for example, from the
.Pa /etc/rc
script.
.Pp
Note that not all options make sense in every particular case,
and an attempt to set some of them may hung up the channel
or the whole adapter.
.\"--------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss "Information Options"
Only one of these options can be specified.
If information option is specified,
.Nm
will show the corresponding information and will ignore all other options,
except
.Ar device .
See also the description of the
.Ar device
argument.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It <none>
This will show settings of the channel.
.It Fl a
Print all settings of the channel.
.It Fl i
Print interface settings, equal to the output of the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility.
.It Fl m
Print modem signal status.
The description of all signals can be found in any modem documentation.
Only LE signal should be described.
If this signal is ON then the channel is busy.
If it is OFF then the channel is free.
.It Fl s
Print brief channel statistics.
This is the generic statistics,
see also the
.Fl x , e , f , t ,
and
.Fl u
options.
For a description of the output, see below.
.Pp
This statistics is very useful if something goes wrong.
For example, if all interrupt counters are zero then the device
was configured to use an interrupt that was not registered in the
BIOS for use with the ISA bus.
.It Fl x
Print full channel statistics.
This options prints additional counters,
but with less precision than with the
.Fl s
option.
.It Fl e
Print brief E1/G703 statistics.
If this option is selected, the
statistics accumulated over the last 15 minutes is printed.
For a description of the output, see below.
.It Fl f
Print full E1/G703 statistics.
This option shows all E1/G703 statistics that the
.Fl e
option shows,
plus total statistics for the whole period of time and statistics for
last 24 hours (if available).
For a description of the output, see below.
.It Fl t
Print brief E3/T3/STS-1 statistics.
If this option is selected, the
statistics accumulated over the last 15 minutes is printed.
For a description of the output, see below.
.It Fl u
Print full E3/T3/STS-1 statistics.
This option shows all E3/T3/STS-1 statistics that the
.Fl t
option shows,
plus total statistics for the whole period of time and statistics for
last 24 hours (if available).
For a description of the output, see below.
.It Fl c
Cleans all kind of statistics.
.El
.\"--------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss "Device Selection"
The device is selected using the name of the network interface,
as shown by
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
The channel number depends on the order the drivers were loaded into the system.
Sometimes people confuse channel number and adapter number because of the
same spelling.
The adapter number appears in the kernel context, while the channel number
is in the configuration context.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It <none>
If the device name is omitted,
.Nm
will print information about all channels of all Cronyx adapters
available in the system.
If some settings need to be made, the device name must be specified.
.It Li cx Ns Ar ##
This is the channel name for the Sigma family of Cronyx adapters.
(ISA bus.)
.It Li ct Ns Ar ##
This is the channel name for the Tau family of Cronyx adapters.
(ISA bus.)
.It Li cp Ns Ar ##
This is the channel name for the Tau-PCI family of Cronyx adapters.
(PCI bus.)
.It Li ce Ns Ar ##
This is the channel name for the Tau32-PCI family of Cronyx adapters.
(PCI bus.)
.El
.\"--------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss "Data Rate Options"
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar value
A non-zero value will set the data rate to a given value
in asynchronous mode,
and will set the data rate and internal clock source of synchronization
in synchronous mode.
A zero value is equivalent to specifying the
.Cm extclock
option.
The transmitted data (TxD) are synchronized using the internal on-board timing
generator, the internally generated timing signal is driven on the TXCOUT pin,
and the signal on the TXCIN pin is ignored.
This mode is used for direct
terminal-to-terminal communication, e.g., when connecting two computers together
in synchronous mode with a relatively short cable.
This method should also be
used for testing channels with an external loopback connector.
.It Cm extclock
Set the external timing clock source for synchronous channels.
External clock mode is the most commonly used method for connecting
external modem hardware.
In this mode,
the external timing signal is received on the TXCIN pin of the connector,
and it is used as a synchronization clock for transmitting data (TxD).
.Pp
Note: in
.Cm extclock
mode, the device cannot determine the value of the external timing clock
since it does not have the built-in clock gauge.
.El
.\"--------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss "Protocol Options"
Note: these option can only be used on a free channel, and they require
specifying the device name.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm async
(Only for Sigma family.)
Select the asynchronous protocol (or mode).
In this mode, Cronyx adapters behave as normal serial devices,
and standard serial communications utilities can be used to
work with them.
All asynchronous settings should be set using the standard
serial communications configuration utilities, e.g.,
.Xr stty 1 .
With
.Nm ,
it is only possible to set some of them.
.It Cm cisco
Select the Cisco HDLC synchronous protocol.
.It Cm fr
Select the Frame Relay synchronous protocol
.Tn ( ANSI
T1.617 Annex D).
.It Cm ppp
Select the synchronous PPP protocol.
PPP parameters can be configured using the
.Xr spppcontrol 8
utility.
.It Sm Cm keepalive No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
Turn on/off transmission of keepalive messages.
This option is used only for synchronous PPP.
If this option is
.Cm on ,
PPP will periodically send ECHO-REQUEST messages.
If it will not receive any ECHO-REPLY messages for
some (definite) period of time it will break the connection.
It is used for tracking the line state.
.It Cm idle
This mode is reported when using Netgraph.
An actual protocol depends on the type of a connected Netgraph node,
and it cannot be changed with
.Nm .
.El
.\"--------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss "Interface Options"
Not all of these options can be set on a busy channel, and not all of them
are applicable to all kinds of adapters/channels.
For all dual-state options,
.Cm off
is the default value.
None of these options can be used in the asynchronous mode,
except for the
.Cm debug
option.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sm Cm port No = Bro Cm rs232 , v35 , rs449 Brc Sm
Set the port type for old Sigma models.
.It Sm Cm cfg No = Bro Cm A , B , C Brc Sm
Set the configuration for the adapter.
This option can be used only with Tau/E1
and Tau/G703 adapters, and only if all channels are free.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm cfg Ns = Ns Cm A"
.It Cm cfg Ns = Ns Cm A
Two independent E1/G703 channels.
This is the default setting.
.It Cm cfg Ns = Ns Cm B
(Only for ISA models.)
For Tau/G703 this means one G703 channel and one digital channel.
For Tau/E1, the first physical channel is divided into two subchannels.
One of them goes to the first logical channel, another one goes to the
second physical channel.
Second (logical) channel is the digital channel.
.It Cm cfg Ns = Ns Cm C
(Only for E1 models.)
In this mode, first
physical channel consists of three data flows.
Two of them go to the two (logical) channels.
The last one goes to the second physical channel.
On newer models (Tau32-PCI, Tau-PCI/2E1 and Tau-PCI/4E1),
this programs the hardware to use a single source of synchronization
and pass all unused (in both channels) timeslots from
one channel to another.
.El
.Pp
For a detailed description of available configuration modes,
see the adapter documentation.
This option cannot be set on a busy channel.
.It Sm Cm loop No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
Turn on/off internal loopback.
This mode is useful for debugging.
When this mode is
.Cm on ,
some data should be sent.
If no interrupts are generated, chances are that
the corresponding IRQ configuration entry in the BIOS
was not switched from
.Dq Li "PCI/ISA PNP"
to
.Dq Li "Legacy ISA" .
.It Sm Cm rloop No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Only for Tau32-PCI and Tau-PCI/E3.)
Turn on/off remote loopback feature.
This mode is also useful for debugging.
.It Sm Cm dpll No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
Turn on/off digital phase locked loop mode (DPLL).
When enabled, the receiver
timing clock signal is derived from the received data.
Must be used with the NRZI
encoding to avoid the synchronization loss.
.It Sm Cm nrzi No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
Turn on/off NRZI encoding.
If
.Cm off ,
NRZ encoding is used.
.Bl -tag -width "NRZI"
.It NRZ
The zero bit is transmitted by the zero signal level,
the one bit is transmitted by the positive signal level.
.It NRZI
The zero bit is transmitted by the change of the signal
level, the one bit is by the constant signal level.
Commonly used with the
.Cm dpll Ns = Ns Cm on
option.
.El
.It Sm Cm invclk No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Tau and Tau-PCI only.)
Invert both the transmit and receive clock signals.
.It Sm Cm invrclk No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Tau-PCI only.)
Invert the receive clock signals.
.It Sm Cm invtclk No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Tau-PCI only.)
Invert the transmit clock signals.
.It Sm Cm higain No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(E1 only.)
In off state the sensitivity is -12 dB.
Turn on/off increasing the E1 receiver's non-linear sensitivity to -30dB.
This allows increasing of the line distance.
.It Sm Cm cablen No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Tau-PCI/T3 and Tau-PCI/STS-1 only.)
Turn on/off adjusting of the transmit signal for a long cable T3/STS-1.
.It Sm Cm monitor No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Tau32-PCI, Tau-PCI/2E1 and Tau-PCI/4E1 only.)
Turn on/off increasing of the E1 receiver's linear sensitivity to -30dB.
This can be used for the interception purposes.
.It Sm Cm phony No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Tau32-PCI and Tau-PCI E1 family only.)
Turn on/off the so-called
.Dq phony
mode.
This mode allows
receiving raw CEPT frames from the E1 line.
Raw frames can be accessed, for example, with the raw protocol.
Packets would come at a rate of 500 frames per second
with length
.No 16* Ns Ar N
(for Tau-PCI/E1 model), where
.Ar N
is the number of timeslots.
For
Tau-PCI/2E1 and Tau-PCI/4E1,
.Ar N
should be equal to 32 regardless of the number of
used timeslots.
.It Sm Cm unfram No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Tau32-PCI, Tau-PCI/2E1 and Tau-PCI/4E1 only.)
Turn on/off unframed mode.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm unfram Ns = Ns Cm off"
.It Cm unfram Ns = Ns Cm on
Switch channel to the unframed G.703 mode.
.It Cm unfram Ns = Ns Cm off
Switch channel to the framed E1 (G.704) mode.
.El
.It Sm Cm scrambler No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Tau32-PCI, Tau-PCI/G.703, Tau-PCI/2E1, and
Tau-PCI/4E1 in unframed mode only.)
Turn on/off scrambling of the G.703 data.
.It Sm Cm use16 No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(Tau32-PCI and Tau-PCI E1 family only.)
Turn on/off the usage of the 16th timeslot for data transmission.
Normally, the 16th timeslot is used for signalling information
(multiframing CAS).
.It Sm Cm crc4 No = Bro Cm on , off Brc Sm
(E1 only.)
Turn on/off CRC4 superframe mode.
.It Sm Cm syn No = Bro Cm int , rcv , rcv0 , rcv1 , rcv2 , rcv3 Brc Sm
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm rcv3"
.It Cm int
Use an internal clock generator for G703 transmitter
(clock master).
.It Cm rcv
Use the G703 receiver data clock as the transmit clock
(clock slave).
.It Cm rcv0 , rcv1 , rcv2 , rcv3
Use the G703 receiver clock of the other channel
(E1 models only).
.El
.It Cm dir Ns = Ns Ar number
(Tau32-PCI, Tau-PCI/2E1 and Tau-PCI/4E1 only.)
Bind a logical channel to a physical channel.
Using this parameter it is possible, for example, to split
physical E1 channel into several logical channels.
.It Cm ts Ns = Ns Ar interval
(E1 only.)
Set up the list of timeslots for use by the channel.
The timeslots are numbered from 1 to 31,
and are separated by a comma or a minus sign,
giving an interval.
Example:
.Dq Li ts=1-3,5,17 .
.It Cm pass Ns = Ns Ar interval
(Tau/E1 only.)
Set up the list of timeslots, translated to the E1 subchannel in
.Cm cfg Ns = Ns Cm B
and
.Cm cfg Ns = Ns Cm C
configurations.
.It Sm Cm debug No = Bro Cm 0 , 1 , 2 Brc Sm
Turn on/off debug messages.
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Cm 0
Turn debug messages off.
.It Cm 1
Turn debug messages on, equivalent to the
.Cm debug
option of the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility.
.It Cm 2
High intensive debug messages, for developers only.
