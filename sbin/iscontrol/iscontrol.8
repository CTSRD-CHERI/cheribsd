.Dt ISCONTROL 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm iscontrol
.Nd login/negotiator/control for an iSCSI initiator session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Oo
.Fl c Ar file
.Op Fl n Ar nickname
.Oc
.Op Fl p Ar pidfile
.Op Fl t Ar target
.Op Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This command, along with its kernel counterpart
.Xr iscsi_initiator 4 ,
is obsolete.
Users are advised to use
.Xr iscsictl 8
instead.
.Ef
.Pp
Internet SCSI (iSCSI) is a network protocol standard, that allows the
use of the SCSI protocol over TCP/IP networks,
the
.Nm
program is the userland side of an iSCSI session, see
.Xr iscsi_initiator 4 .
It has 2 modes of operation, if -d (discovery session) is specified,
it will print out the
.Em target names
returned by the target and exit.
In the second mode, it will, after a successful login/negotiation, run
in daemon mode, monitoring the connection, and will try to reconnect
in case of a network/target failure.
It will terminate/logout the session
when a SIGHUP signal is received.
The flags are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width variable=value
.It Fl c Ar file
a file containing configuration
.Em key-options ,
see
.Xr iscsi.conf 5 .
.It Fl d
do a
.Em discovery session
and exit.
.It Fl n Ar nickname
if
.Sy -c file
is specified, then search for the block named
.Em nickname
in that file, see
.Xr iscsi.conf 5 .
.It Fl p Ar pidfile
will write the process ID of the session to the specified
.Em pidfile
.It Fl t Ar target
the target's IP address or name.
.It Fl v
verbose mode.
.It Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value
see
.Xr iscsi.conf 5
for the complete list of variables/options and their
possible values.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl iscontrol -dt myiscsitarget
.Pp
will start a
.Em discovery session
with the target and
print to stdout the list of available targetnames/targetadresses.
Note: this listing does not necessarily mean availability, since
depending on the target configuration, a discovery session might
not need login/access permission, but a
.Em full session
certainly does.
.sp
.Dl iscontrol -c /etc/iscsi.conf -n myiscsi
.Pp
will read options from
.Pa /etc/iscsi.conf ,
use the targetaddress
found in the block nicknamed myiscsi, login and negotiate
whatever options are specified, and start an iscsi-session.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
Fx 7.0 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
should probably load the iscsi_initiator module if needed.
.br
Not all functions/specifications have been implemented yet, noticeably
missing are the Task Management Functions.
The error recovery, though not
.Em fully compliant
does a brave effort to recover from network disconnects.
