.Sh NAME
.Nm ndis
.Nd NDIS miniport driver wrapper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options NDISAPI"
.Cd "device ndis"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is a wrapper designed to allow binary
.Tn Windows\[rg]
NDIS miniport
network drivers to be used with
.Fx .
The
.Nm
driver is provided in source code form and must be combined with
the
.Tn Windows\[rg]
driver supplied with your network adapter.
The
.Nm
driver uses the
.Nm ndisapi
kernel subsystem to relocate and link the
.Tn Windows\[rg]
binary so
that it can be used in conjunction with native code.
The
.Nm ndisapi
subsystem provides an interface between the NDIS API and the
.Fx
networking infrastructure.
The
.Tn Windows\[rg]
driver is essentially
fooled into thinking it is running on
.Tn Windows\[rg] .
Note that this
means the
.Nm
driver is only useful on x86 machines.
.Pp
To build a functional driver, the user must have a copy of the
driver distribution media for his or her card.
From this distribution,
the user must extract two files: the
.Pa .SYS
file containing the driver
binary code, and its companion
.Pa .INF
file, which contains the
definitions for driver-specific registry keys and other installation
data such as device identifiers.
These two files can be converted
into a kernel module file using the
.Xr ndisgen 8
utility.
This file contains a binary image of the driver plus
registry key data.
When the
.Nm
driver loads, it will create
.Xr sysctl 3
nodes for each registry key extracted from the
.Pa .INF
file.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver is designed to support mainly Ethernet and wireless
network devices with PCI, PCMCIA and USB bus attachments.
(Cardbus
devices are also supported as a subset of PCI.)
It can
support many different media types and speeds.
One limitation
however, is that there is no consistent way to learn if an
Ethernet device is operating in full or half duplex mode.
The NDIS API allows for a generic means for determining link
state and speed, but not the duplex setting.
There may be
driver-specific registry keys to control the media setting
which can be configured via the
.Xr sysctl 8
command.
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
The PC Card attachment of this driver is scheduled for removal prior to the release of
.Fx 13.0
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ndis%d: watchdog timeout"
A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was
issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
