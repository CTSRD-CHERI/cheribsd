.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
starts the
.Ar command
with its
.Ar args .
If the
.Ar command
is still running after
.Ar duration ,
it is killed.
By default,
.Dv SIGTERM
is sent.
The special
.Ar duration ,
zero, signifies no limit.
Therefore a signal is never sent if
.Ar duration
is 0.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -preserve-status
Exit with the same status as
.Ar command ,
even if it times out and is killed.
.It Fl -foreground
Do not propagate timeout to the children of
.Ar command .
.It Fl s Ar sig , Fl -signal Ar sig
Specify the signal to send on timeout.
By default,
.Dv SIGTERM
is sent.
.It Fl k Ar time , Fl -kill-after Ar time
Send a
.Dv SIGKILL
signal if
.Ar command
is still running after
.Ar time
after the first signal was sent.
.El
.Sh DURATION FORMAT
.Ar duration
and
.Ar time
are non-negative integer or real (decimal) numbers, with an optional
unit-specifying suffix.
Values without an explicit unit are interpreted as seconds.
.Pp
Supported unit symbols are:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Cm s
seconds
.It Cm m
minutes
.It Cm h

.Sh EXIT STATUS
If the timeout was not reached, the exit status of
.Ar command
is returned.
.Pp
If the timeout was reached and
.Fl -preserve-status
is set, the exit status of
.Ar command
is returned.
If
.Fl -preserve-status
is not set, an exit status of 124 is returned.
.Pp
If
.Ar command
exits after receiving a signal, the exit status returned is the signal number
plus 128.
.Pp
If
.Ar command
refers to a non-existing program, the exit status returned is 127.
.Pp
If
.Ar command
is an otherwise invalid program, the exit status returned is 126.
