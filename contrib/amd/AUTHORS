PRIMARY AUTHORS AND MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO AM_UTILS:
Original authors of amd were the Berkeley team and especially Jan-Simon
Pendry.  Since then many people have contributed patches.

This file lists the ones who contributed major code changes, in no
particular order, and I thank them all.  This is of course not to diminish
the smaller contributes of the many others.  Thank you all.

* Erez Zadok <ezk AT cs.sunysb.edu>

The most significant changes were made by Erez Zadok in terms of bug fixes,
ports, and new features added.  Erez Zadok is the current maintainer of
am-utils, as of January 1997.
