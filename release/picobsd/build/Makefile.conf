# Makefile for building PICOBSD kernels and running crunchgen
#
# Needs SRC pointing to the source tree,
# MY_TREE ponting to my tree
# BUILDDIR pointing to the build directory
# PICO_OBJ pointing to the object directory
# When building a kernel, also need ${name} from the environment
# and CONFIG may indicate an alternate config program

KERNCONF ?= PICOBSD

# caller will set MODULES to empty if modules are needed.
# Indeed, it can be used to specify other Makefile options as well.

# These 3 variables determine where the kernel is built.

# file in some other place than ${SRC}/sys/${TARGET_ARCH}/conf, but
# at the moment (Oct.2001) this is not possible yet.
