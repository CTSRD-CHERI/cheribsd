.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcasper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/nv.h
.In libcasper.h
.In libcasper_service.h
.Bd -literal
typedef int service_limit_func_t(const nvlist_t *, const nvlist_t *);

typedef int service_command_func_t(const char *, const nvlist_t *, nvlist_t *,
    nvlist_t *);

.Ed
.Fn CREATE_SERVICE "name" "limit_func" "command_func" "flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm CREATE_SERVICE
macro to create a new Casper service.
The
.Fa name
is a string containing the service name, which will be used in the
.Xr cap_service_open 3,
function to identify it.
.Pp
The
.Fa limit_func
is a function of type
.Li service_limit_func_t .
The first argument of the function contains
.Xr nvlist 9 ,
old service limits and second one the new limits.
If the services wasn't limited the old limits will be set to
.Dv NULL .
This function should not allow to extend service limits and only limit it
further.
The
.Fa command_func
is a function of type
.Li service_command_func_t .
First argument is the name of the command that should be executed.
The first
.Xr nvlist 9
contains the current limits.
Next one contains a
.Xr nvlist 9
with current request.
The last one contains an output
.Xr nvlist 9
which contains the response from Casper.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument defines limits of the service.
The supported flags are:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It CASPER_SERVICE_STDIO
The Casper service has access to the stdio descriptors from the process it was
spawned from.
.It CASPER_SERVICE_FD
The Casper service has access to all descriptors besides stdio descriptors from
the process it was spawned from.
.It CASPER_SERVICE_NO_UNIQ_LIMITS
The whole Casper communication is using
.Xr nvlist 9
with
.Xr NVLIST_NO_UNIQ 9
flag.
