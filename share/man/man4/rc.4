.Dt RC 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc
.Nd RISCom/8 multiport card
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device isa
.Cd device rc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn RISCom/8
is an eight port
.Tn ISA
.Tn RS-232C
communications multiplexer with a built in
.Tn RISC
processor.
It uses a block of sixteen
.Tn I/O
ports in the range 0x200 to 0x3f0 selectable by on-board
switches or jumpers.
The block must be aligned on a sixteen port boundary.
The jumper-selectable hardware interrupt level may be set to
be detected during system
initialization using settings found in the
.Pa /boot/device.hints
file.
.Pp
This driver is mostly based on the Cirrus Logic CL-CD180 driver.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn SDL
Communications
.Tn RISCom/8
boards.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The following driver specific error messages
may be reported:
.Bl -diag
.It "rc%d channel%d: interrupt-level buffer overflow"
An internal buffer overflow error has occurred on
the listed channel.
The
.Nm
driver will need to be reloaded to correct this.
.It "rc%d: Bad char chan %d"
The channel has obtained a bad set of characters.
.It "rc%d: Got extra chars chan %d"
The
.Nm
driver got more characters than expected on the channel shown.
.It "rc%d: data mismatch chan %d ptr %d (%d != %d)"
Data sent from channel
.Ar %d
to the rx buffer was different then expected.
.It "rc%d: channel %d command timeout, rc.c line: %d"
A command timeout has occurred on the channel, the
.Pa src/sys/dev/rc/rc.c
file can be consulted for more information.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 2.0.5 .
This manual page first appeared in
.Fx 5.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This manual page was written by
.An Tom Rhodes Aq Mt trhodes@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver code still uses the
.Xr spl 9
functions.
These should be replaced by
.Xr mutex 9
functions.
.Pp
The various
.Fn ttyld_*
functions should be documented.
