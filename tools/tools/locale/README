# $FreeBSD$

Files in this directory are used to generate locale source files
from files in CLDR (Unicode Common Locale Data Repository). 

To generate the files, do the following:

	cd /usr/src/tools/tools/locale
	make obj	(mandatory)
	make -j16	(-jN recommended)
	make diff	(check if the changes are reasonable)
	make install

"make" downloads the necessary files, build them, and install the
results into /usr/src/share/* as source files for locales.

More details are as follows:

Variables:
	LOCALESRCDIR
		Destination path for the generated locale files.
		Default: $DESTDIR/usr/src/share.
	TMPDIR
		Temporary directory.
		Default: /tmp

Targets:
	make obj
		Create a temporary directory for building.

	make clean
		Clean up the obj directories.

	make cleandir
		Remove the obj directories completely.

	make tools-test
		Check if necessary tools are installed or not.
		If something is missing, install them.

	make fetch
		Download necessary files from CLDR.

	make build-tools
		Build a tool to generate locale source files.

	make posix
		Build POSIX locale source files.

	make build
		Build locale files.

	make diff
		Run diff(1) the build results against $LOCALESRCDIR.

	make install
		Install the build results into $LOCALESRCDIR.
