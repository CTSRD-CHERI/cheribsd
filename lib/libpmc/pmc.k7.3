.Sh NAME
.Nm pmc.k7
.Nd measurement events for
.Tn AMD
.Tn Athlon
(K7 family) CPUs
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpmc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pmc.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
AMD K7 PMCs are present in the
.Tn "AMD Athlon"
series of CPUs and are documented in:
.Rs
.%B "AMD Athlon Processor x86 Code Optimization Guide"
.%N "Publication No. 22007"
.%D "February 2002"
.%Q "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc."
.Re
.Ss PMC Features
AMD K7 PMCs are 48 bits wide.
Each K7 CPU contains 4 PMCs with the following capabilities:
.Bl -column "PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT" "Support"
.It Em Capability Ta Em Support
.It PMC_CAP_CASCADE Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_EDGE Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_INVERT Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_READ Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_PRECISE Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_SYSTEM Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_TAGGING Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_THRESHOLD Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_USER Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_WRITE Ta Yes
.El
.Ss Event Qualifiers
Event specifiers for AMD K7 PMCs can have the following optional
qualifiers:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li count= Ns Ar value
Configure the counter to increment only if the number of configured
events measured in a cycle is greater than or equal to
.Ar value .
.It Li edge
Configure the counter to only count negated-to-asserted transitions
of the conditions expressed by the other qualifiers.
In other words, the counter will increment only once whenever a given
condition becomes true, irrespective of the number of clocks during
which the condition remains true.
.It Li inv
Invert the sense of comparison when the
.Dq Li count
qualifier is present, making the counter to increment when the
number of events per cycle is less than the value specified by
the
.Dq Li count
qualifier.
.It Li os
Configure the PMC to count events happening at privilege level 0.
.It Li unitmask= Ns Ar mask
This qualifier is used to further qualify a select few events,
.Dq Li k7-dc-refills-from-l2 ,
.Dq Li k7-dc-refills-from-system
and
.Dq Li k7-dc-writebacks .
Here
.Ar mask
is a string of the following characters optionally separated by
.Ql +
characters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li m
Count operations for lines in the
.Dq Modified
state.
.It Li o
Count operations for lines in the
.Dq Owner
state.
.It Li e
Count operations for lines in the
.Dq Exclusive
state.
.It Li s
Count operations for lines in the
.Dq Shared
state.
.It Li i
Count operations for lines in the
.Dq Invalid
state.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Dq Li unitmask
qualifier is specified, the default is to count events for caches
lines in any of the above states.
.It Li usr
Configure the PMC to count events occurring at privilege levels 1, 2
or 3.
.El
.Pp
If neither of the
.Dq Li os
or
.Dq Li usr
qualifiers were specified, the default is to enable both.
.Ss AMD K7 Event Specifiers
The event specifiers supported on AMD K7 PMCs are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li k7-dc-accesses
.Pq Event 40H
Count data cache accesses.
.It Li k7-dc-misses
.Pq Event 41H
Count data cache misses.
.It Li k7-dc-refills-from-l2 Op Li ,unitmask= Ns Ar mask
.Pq Event 42H
Count data cache refills from L2 cache.
This event may be further qualified using the
.Dq Li unitmask
qualifier.
.It Li k7-dc-refills-from-system Op Li ,unitmask= Ns Ar mask
.Pq Event 43H
Count data cache refills from system memory.
This event may be further qualified using the
.Dq Li unitmask
qualifier.
.It Li k7-dc-writebacks Op Li ,unitmask= Ns Ar mask
.Pq Event 44H
Count data cache writebacks.
This event may be further qualified using the
.Dq Li unitmask
qualifier.
.It Li k7-hardware-interrupts
.Pq Event CFH
Count the number of taken hardware interrupts.
.It Li k7-ic-fetches
.Pq Event 80H
Count instruction cache fetches.
.It Li k7-ic-misses
.Pq Event 81H
Count instruction cache misses.
.It Li k7-interrupts-masked-cycles
.Pq Event CDH
Count the number of cycles when the processor's
.Va IF
flag was zero.
.It Li k7-interrupts-masked-while-pending-cycles
.Pq Event CEH
Count the number of cycles interrupts were masked while pending due
to the processor's
.Va IF
flag being zero.
.It Li k7-l1-and-l2-dtlb-misses
.Pq Event 46H
Count L1 and L2 DTLB misses.
.It Li k7-l1-dtlb-miss-and-l2-dtlb-hits
.Pq Event 45H
Count L1 DTLB misses and L2 DTLB hits.
.It Li k7-l1-itlb-misses
.Pq Event 84H
Count L1 ITLB misses that are L2 ITLB hits.
.It Li k7-l1-l2-itlb-misses
.Pq Event 85H
