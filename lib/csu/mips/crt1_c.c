 * crt1_s.s, and necessarily written in raw assembly so that it can re-align
 * the stack before setting up the first stack frame and calling _start1().
 *
 * It would be nice to be able to hide the _start1 symbol, but that's not
 * possible, since it must be present in the GOT in order to be resolvable by
 * the position independent code in __start.
