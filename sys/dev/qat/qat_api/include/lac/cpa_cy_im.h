 *
 * @description
 *      This function will stop the Cryptographic component and free
 *      all system resources associated with it. The client MUST ensure that
 *      all outstanding operations have completed before calling this function.
 *      The recommended approach to ensure this is to deregister all session or
 *      callback handles before calling this function. If outstanding
 *      operations still exist when this function is invoked, the callback
 *      function for each of those operations will NOT be invoked and the
 *      shutdown will continue.  If the component is to be restarted, then a
 *      call to cpaCyStartInstance is required.
 *

 *      This function may sleep, and so MUST NOT be called in interrupt
 *      context.

 * @retval CPA_STATUS_FAIL          Function failed. Suggested course of action
 *                                  is to ensure requests are not still being
 *                                  submitted and that all sessions are
 *                                  deregistered. If this does not help, then
 *                                  forcefully remove the component from the
