/*
 * AM335x PPS driver using DMTimer capture.
 *
 * Note that this PPS driver does not use an interrupt.  Instead it uses the
 * hardware's ability to latch the timer's count register in response to a
 * signal on an IO pin.  Each of timers 4-7 have an associated pin, and this
 * code allows any one of those to be used.
 *
 * The timecounter routines in kern_tc.c call the pps poll routine periodically
 * to see if a new counter value has been latched.  When a new value has been
 * latched, the only processing done in the poll routine is to capture the
 * current set of timecounter timehands (done with pps_capture()) and the
 * latched value from the timer.  The remaining work (done by pps_event() while
 * holding a mutex) is scheduled to be done later in a non-interrupt context.
