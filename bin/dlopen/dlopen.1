.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility supports analysis of the linkage and loading behavior of dynamically
loaded libraries without the need for custom software.
It loads each library listed on the command line and then waits for
input on stdin unless the
.Fl s
flag is used to pass a positive number of seconds to sleep.
.Pp
The
.Fl L
and
.Fl N
flags control the use of
.Dv RTLD_LAZY
versus
.Dv RTLD_NOW
flags.
.Dv RTLD_NOW
is the
.Nm
utility's default.
Likewise
.Fl g
and
.Fl l
control the use of
.Dv RTLD_GLOBAL
or
.Dv RTLD_LOCAL .
The
.Fl v
flag enables verbose mode.
