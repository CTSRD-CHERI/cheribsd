/*
 * Round p (pointer or byte index) up to a correctly-aligned value for all
 * data types (int, long, ...).	  The result is u_long and must be cast to
 * any desired pointer type.
 *
 * XXXCHERI: Changed '7' to 'sizeof(void *) - 1'.
 *
 * XXXBD: the builtin version is type-preserving.  This is an API
 * change, but has uncovered subtle bugs libc so we're going with it.
 * The regular macro could be made type-preserving with some gnu
 * macro extentions...
