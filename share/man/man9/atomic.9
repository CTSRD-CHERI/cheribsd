.Sh DESCRIPTION
All of these operations are performed atomically across multiple
threads and in the presence of interrupts, meaning that they are               
performed in an indivisible manner from the perspective of concurrently
running threads and interrupt handlers.
.Pp
When atomic operations are performed on cache-coherent memory, all
operations on the same location are totally ordered.
.Pp
When an atomic load is performed on a location in cache-coherent memory,
it reads the entire value that was defined by the last atomic store to
each byte of the location.
An atomic load will never return a value out of thin air.
When an atomic store is performed on a location, no other thread or
interrupt handler will observe a
.Em torn write ,
or partial modification of the location.
.Pp
On all architectures supported by
.Fx ,
ordinary loads and stores of naturally aligned integer types
are atomic, as executed by the processor.
.Pp
Atomic operations can be used to implement reference counts or as
building blocks for synchronization primitives such as mutexes.
.Pp
The semantics of
.Fx Ns 's
atomic operations are almost identical to those of the similarly named
C11 operations.
The one important difference is that the C11 standard does not
require ordinary loads and stores to ever be atomic.
This is is why the
.Fn atomic_load_explicit memory_order_relaxed
operation exists in the C11 standard, but is not provided by
.In machine/atomic.h .
.Ss Types
Each atomic operation operates on a specific
.Fa type .
The type to use is indicated in the function name.
The available types that can be used are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width short -compact
.It Li int
unsigned integer
.It Li long
unsigned long integer
.It Li ptr
unsigned integer the size of a pointer
.It Li 32
unsigned 32-bit integer
.It Li 64
unsigned 64-bit integer
.El
.Pp
For example, the function to atomically add two integers is called
.Fn atomic_add_int .
.Pp
Certain architectures also provide operations for types smaller than
.Dq Li int .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width short -compact
.It Li char
unsigned character
.It Li short
unsigned short integer
.It Li 8
unsigned 8-bit integer
.It Li 16
unsigned 16-bit integer
.El
.Pp
These must not be used in MI code because the instructions to implement them
efficiently might not be available.
.Ss Acquire and Release Operations
By default, a thread's accesses to different memory locations might not be
performed in
.Em program order ,
that is, the order in which the accesses appear in the source code.
To optimize the program's execution, both the compiler and processor might
reorder the thread's accesses.
However, both ensure that their reordering of the accesses is not visible to
the thread.
Otherwise, the traditional memory model that is expected by single-threaded
programs would be violated.
Nonetheless, other threads in a multithreaded program, such as the
.Fx
kernel, might observe the reordering.
Moreover, in some cases, such as the implementation of synchronization between
threads, arbitrary reordering might result in the incorrect execution of the
program.
To constrain the reordering that both the compiler and processor might perform
on a thread's accesses, the thread should use atomic operations with
.Em acquire
and
.Em release
semantics.
.Pp
Most of the atomic operations on memory have three variants.
The first variant performs the operation without imposing any ordering
constraints on memory accesses to other locations.
The second variant has acquire semantics, and the third variant has release
semantics.
In effect, operations with acquire and release semantics establish one-way
barriers to reordering.
.Pp
When an atomic operation has acquire semantics, the effects of the operation
must have completed before any subsequent load or store (by program order) is
performed.
Conversely, acquire semantics do not require that prior loads or stores have
completed before the atomic operation is performed.
To denote acquire semantics, the suffix
.Dq Li _acq
is inserted into the function name immediately prior to the
.Dq Li _ Ns Aq Fa type
suffix.
For example, to subtract two integers ensuring that subsequent loads and
stores happen after the subtraction is performed, use
.Fn atomic_subtract_acq_int .
.Pp
When an atomic operation has release semantics, the effects of all prior
loads or stores (by program order) must have completed before the operation
is performed.
Conversely, release semantics do not require that the effects of the
atomic operation must have completed before any subsequent load or store is
performed.
To denote release semantics, the suffix
.Dq Li _rel
is inserted into the function name immediately prior to the
.Dq Li _ Ns Aq Fa type
suffix.
For example, to add two long integers ensuring that all prior loads and
stores happen before the addition, use
.Fn atomic_add_rel_long .
.Pp
The one-way barriers provided by acquire and release operations allow the
implementations of common synchronization primitives to express their
ordering requirements without also imposing unnecessary ordering.
For example, for a critical section guarded by a mutex, an acquire operation
when the mutex is locked and a release operation when the mutex is unlocked
will prevent any loads or stores from moving outside of the critical
section.
However, they will not prevent the compiler or processor from moving loads
or stores into the critical section, which does not violate the semantics of
a mutex.
.Ss Multiple Processors
In multiprocessor systems, the atomicity of the atomic operations on memory
depends on support for cache coherence in the underlying architecture.
In general, cache coherence on the default memory type,
.Dv VM_MEMATTR_DEFAULT ,
is guaranteed by all architectures that are supported by
.Fx .
For example, cache coherence is guaranteed on write-back memory by the
.Tn amd64
and
.Tn i386
architectures.
However, on some architectures, cache coherence might not be enabled on all
memory types.
To determine if cache coherence is enabled for a non-default memory type,
consult the architecture's documentation.
.Ss Semantics
This section describes the semantics of each operation using a C like notation.
.Bl -hang

.Bd -literal -compact

	return (1);
} else
	return (0);
.Ed
.El
.Pp
Some architectures do not implement the
.Fn atomic_cmpset
functions for the types
.Dq Li char ,
.Dq Li short ,
.Dq Li 8 ,
and
.Dq Li 16 .
.Bl -hang
.It Fn atomic_fcmpset dst *old new

.Pp
On architectures implementing
.Em Compare And Swap
operation in hardware, the functionality can be described as
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
if (*dst == *old) {
	*dst = new;
	return (1);
} else {
	*old = *dst;
	return (0);
}
.Ed
On architectures which provide
.Em Load Linked/Store Conditional
primitive, the write to
.Dv *dst
might also fail for several reasons, most important of which
is a parallel write to
.Dv *dst
cache line by other CPU.
In this case
.Fn atomic_fcmpset
function also returns
.Dv false ,
despite
.Dl *old == *dst .
.Pp
Some architectures do not implement the
.Fn atomic_fcmpset
functions for the types
.Dq Li char ,
.Dq Li short ,
.Dq Li 8 ,
and
.Dq Li 16 .
.Bl -hang

.Pp
The

.Pp
The
.Fn atomic_swap
functions are not implemented for the types
.Dq Li char ,

.Ed
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn atomic_testandset
and
.Fn atomic_testandclear
functions are only implemented for the types
.Dq Li int ,
.Dq Li long
and
.Dq Li 32
and do not have any variants with memory barriers at this time.
.Pp
The type
.Dq Li 64
is currently not implemented for any of the atomic operations on the
.Tn arm ,
.Tn i386 ,
and
.Tn powerpc
architectures.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn atomic_cmpset
function returns the result of the compare operation.
The
.Fn atomic_fcmpset
function returns
.Dv true
if the operation succeeded.
Otherwise it returns
.Dv false
and sets
.Va *old
to the found value.
The
.Fn atomic_fetchadd ,
.Fn atomic_load ,
.Fn atomic_readandclear ,
and
.Fn atomic_swap
functions return the value at the specified address.
The
.Fn atomic_testandset
and
.Fn atomic_testandclear
function returns the result of the test operation.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example uses the
.Fn atomic_cmpset_acq_ptr
and
.Fn atomic_set_ptr
functions to obtain a sleep mutex and handle recursion.
Since the
.Va mtx_lock
member of a
.Vt "struct mtx"
is a pointer, the
.Dq Li ptr
type is used.
.Bd -literal
/* Try to obtain mtx_lock once. */
#define _obtain_lock(mp, tid)						\\
	atomic_cmpset_acq_ptr(&(mp)->mtx_lock, MTX_UNOWNED, (tid))

/* Get a sleep lock, deal with recursion inline. */
#define _get_sleep_lock(mp, tid, opts, file, line) do {			\\
	uintptr_t _tid = (uintptr_t)(tid);				\\
									\\
	if (!_obtain_lock(mp, tid)) {					\\
		if (((mp)->mtx_lock & MTX_FLAGMASK) != _tid)		\\
			_mtx_lock_sleep((mp), _tid, (opts), (file), (line));\\
