 * @XGE_HAL_EVENT_SERR: Serious hardware error event.
 * @XGE_HAL_EVENT_LINK_IS_UP: The link state has changed from 'down' to
 * 'up'; upper-layer driver (typically, link layer) is
 * supposed to wake the queue, etc.
 * @XGE_HAL_EVENT_LINK_IS_DOWN: Link-down event.

 * @XGE_HAL_EVENT_ECCERR: ECC error event.
 * @XGE_HAL_EVENT_PARITYERR: Parity error event.
 * @XGE_HAL_EVENT_TARGETABORT: Target abort event. Used when device
 * aborts transmit operation with the corresponding transfer code
 * (for T_CODE enum see xgehal-fifo.h and xgehal-ring.h)
 * @XGE_HAL_EVENT_SLOT_FREEZE: Slot-freeze event. Driver tries to distinguish
