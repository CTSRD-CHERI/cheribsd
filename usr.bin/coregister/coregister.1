.Sh NAME
.Nm coregister
.Nd publish one of capability vector services
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl C
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl v
.Fl i Ar index
.Ar new-name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to publish one of the services found in the inherited
capability vector using
.Xr coregister 2 .
.Pp
XXX
.Pp
Differently from some other utilities, this one does not spawn
any command; instead it just sits there, relaying the calls.
It should probably be run in background.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl s time"
.It Fl C
Do not call
.Xr cap_enter 2 ;
thus do not enter
.Xr capsicum 4
capability mode.
.It Fl i
Publish the service found at offset
.Ar index
in the capability vector inherited from the parent process.
.It Fl k
Use
.Xr coaccept_slow 2
instead of
.Xr coaccept 2 .
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
This also makes
.Nm
send its own answerback instead of relaying them.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Publish a
.Xr clock 1
service as "fabulous", so it can be looked up by that name using
.Xr colookup 2
system call, eg using
.Xr colookup 1
utility:
.Pp
.Dl coregister -i5 fabulous
.Dl coping -v fabulous
.Pp
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr capv 1 ,
.Xr colookup 1 ,
.Xr coregister 2
