.Sh NAME
.Nm ure
.Nd RealTek RTL8152/RTL8153/RTL8156 USB Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device uether"
.Cd "device ure"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_ure_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the RealTek
RTL8152, RTL8153/RTL8153B, and RTL8156/RTL8156B USB Ethernet controllers,
as well as USB Ethernet PHYs provided by
.Xr rgephy 4 .
.Pp
NICs based on the RTL8152 are capable of 10 and 100Mbps.
NICs based on the RTL8153 or provided by
.Xr rgephy 4
are capable of 10, 100, and 1000Mbps.
NICs based on the RTL8156 are capable of 10, 100, 1000, and 2500Mbps operation.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width "10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable auto selection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the auto selected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX (Gigabit Ethernet) operation over twisted pair.
The RealTek gigE chips support 1000Mbps in
.Cm full-duplex
mode only.
.It Cm 2500base-T
Set 2500Base-T operation over twisted pair.
The RealTek 8156/8156B chips support 2500Mbps in
.Cm full-duplex
mode only.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options for 10/100 operation:
.Bl -tag -width "full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full-duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half-duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ure%d: watchdog timeout"
A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was
issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
